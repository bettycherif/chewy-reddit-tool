She was the “last thing” I have from when my family was still together and when i had rose colored glasses on so felt like we were happy. It brought up a lot of family issues on top of everything so I’ve really been struggling this month. My chihuahua, Chewy, and her were also very close so he was definitely grieving the first few days but seems to be okay now. Although he still always sniffs her grave and the flowers on it but will never step on it. My other kitty lily hides a lot so it was hard to see how she was doing. 

When chewy had his neck issue chewy helped me so much when I had issues with auto ship and returns. I mentioned chewy being hurt and explained the situation with the first vet bringing up euthanasia although it was 2 weeks in and my second vet said their steroid dose was half of what he should be on and shocked they didn’t even do Steroid injections. So many people hopped into the email chain wishing us well and it made me feel so much support during the hard time. 

I ordered an obnoxious amount of cat treats since it was buy 1 get 1 half off and they were Boo’s favorite. I haven’t seen them in the store in awhile and they were much cheaper. I had to email them for another return and added that Boo passed but thanked them for having her treats in stock so although i had no clue it was going to be her final few days, she was able to enjoy her favorite treats. Again people hopped onto the email chain wishing me all the love. 

I only set up a profile on chewy for chewy (totally forgot I did that) and it has a photo of him. They sent it to my dad’s house on accident but he brought it over. can you believe someone at chewy painted this canvas of my little guy FOR FREE and with a card basically saying we hope you like this and we’re showing you how much we care. 

I literally cannot stop staring at the canvas. It looks so much like him (I added the photo of I’m for comparison). I’ve never felt so much love from a company. 😭🥹❤️ I loved shopping there at first because they return your money but have you just donate the item to a shelter or someone in need which is beautiful. I had to return a bag of dry food my girls didn’t like but kept it for the local stray cats (one is basically mine were working on trying to get him to come in). But the fact that I got so much sympathy and love during two very difficult times and now this canvas. I will never not shop there. 


Sorry for the rambling. This year was just do hard dealing with Chewy’s injury and now losing my bear and for a company to treat me like this really warmed my heart. ",post,765,1,63,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf0cf9,Chewy

The company is grabagun. I'm in this industry. I've looked at Amazon and chewy to learn what multipliers for ecom businesses could be.

The TLDR is that this company is not even a strong brand, it has 4% EBITDA, is way low tech compared to Amazon or chewy, has no major advantage in the industry. Made $99M last year, but somehow is being valued with a 37x EBITDA?

Like many of you, I've enjoyed the sammies from Nightingale since they hit the scene almost a decade ago, though admittedly I haven't had as many recently. I learned that as of this year, they are distributed nationwide through Kroger and Costco. I picked up a box of the Strawberry Shortcake ""chomp size"" at Costco, but was very disappointed with what I got.

The sandwiches were wierdly soft, almost gummy or chewy. The ice cream itself was kind of stretchy? I looked online to see if others noticed this and found one person who described the sandwiches as ""marshmellow or mochi-like"" in their consistency, and I'd agree. I've previously had to let the sandwiches thaw before digging in, but no matter how cold I got these, they were still unnaturally soft. I looked at the ingredients, and sure enough it has a bunch of different gums, emulsifiers, stabilizers, etc. I'm no food chemist, but I'm pretty sure those things were to blame for the unpleasant texture.

Someone mentioned in a comment here that their ingredients got worse as the company got bigger, so I tried to compare the ingredients, but couldn't find the old ingredient list. Cynically, I would expect that to be true, but it's a shame because I had wanted to celebrate our hometown heroes getting deserved recognition.

10,Chewy,chewy company,1hlikqj,N/A,2024-12-24,"At my wit's end, considering surrendering at this point My cat (six year old male Maine coon/Himalayan mix) has caused actual property damage to my apartment with how he insistently keeps peeing in front of my door. As in he has stained the vinyl flooring and the painted wooden floor trim. He poops and OCCASIONALLY pees in the litter box so it's not that he doesn't get the concept, but he will do one in the box, step out, then do the other on the floor. I will go over and clean it up and not two minutes later he's gone back to do it again, even with a freshly scooped box right there.

I took him to the vet and she couldn't find anything wrong with an ultrasound. She had me put him on very expensive Royal Canin Urinary Calm food. Tried that for months, it did nothing besides make his hairballs worse. I tried a Feliway plug-in near the door in case it was stress about me leaving, nothing. Tried two litter boxes at my old place for two cats, also didn't stop him. It just gave him two boxes to pee next to. I've tried different litters, I've even tried this Cat Attract stuff to sprinkle in there that my mom gave me. It feels like I'm out of options.

I can't have company over because I'm paranoid and embarrassed about the smell. (I don't even smell anything anymore, hence the paranoia because no matter how much I clean, I can't tell how noticeable it is.) Not to mention I'm anxious about bringing someone home and opening the door to find a puddle of pee smack in front of us as their first impression to my place. My (suspected) contamination OCD makes cleaning up after him incredibly stressful. I have cried about having to do so before and I'm not proud. Plus I hate being near my entryway because it never really feels clean, especially with the stains.

I love him so, SO much. He was my first cat that I adopted on my own once I moved out after college and he's best friends with my other anxious little girl cat who I fear would be a nervous wreck if I surrendered him. But also I'm on the edge of yet another nervous breakdown about how much of my life revolves around cat piss and the cleaning/avoidance thereof.

Some advice would be appreciated. Either on new things to try, or if you guys think surrendering would be the best option at this point, addressing the feeling that I'm a bad cat parent and shouldn't have cats at all going forward if I couldn't handle this.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. Since it's been asked a few times, yes he is neutered. No I will not be letting him outside because I live near major roads. And no, his litter isn't scented I'm not sure how people got that idea. I've tried various ""deodorizing"" kinds, but never scented.

Also because a few people have mentioned, yes I have tried puppy pads. This big dumb good boy knows he shouldn't pee ON things, so he just pees right next to them and it seeps under them and it honestly just widens the disaster zone.

It sounds like my next option is going to be trying the ""kitty prozac"" my vet suggested. She made it sound like it was going to be a big expense for life when we talked so I hadn't gone that route yet, but I'll be happy to shop around and see what prices through Chewy and Costco are like.",post,47,0.88,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetAdvice/comments/1hlikqj/at_my_wits_end_considering_surrendering_at_this/,Chewy

How is FedEx allowed to get away with having drivers come in and load trucks for anywhere from 1 - 3 hours and not pay them? 

I usually come in and put in, on average, 2 hours of loading my truck. This can entail anything from fixing the the horrible job the loaders have done up to that point, or having to put away everything that the loaders just dumped at the end of it and never bothered to put away. To add to this, my contractor just told us a couple of weeks ago that FedEx now has a rule that states that as soon as we enter our trucks to start doing anything, the loaders are not required to put anything else on the shelves. 

I've also been told, after asking my boss about this, that if I have a problem with not getting paid to do this that I can just come in later after the loaders are done. This ignores the fact that

A. The loaders do a shit job 99% of the time. 
B. There are days that I have come in after the loaders are done and gone, and there's half of my truck just sitting in a pile at the back of my truck.

There are a couple of drivers who come in, move a couple things and then leave within 15 minutes of arriving. I can't work like that. I need to have my truck in order. If I just took my truck out as is, I'd be out there for at least 2 more hours looking for stuff or trying to get 120lb bookcases out of the back of my truck that were loaded behind the driver seat and has 6 Chewy boxes on top of it. 

I've yet to hear a reason why we are expected to do this work and yet don't get paid until we're out on the road delivering. Yeah, I only deliver for about 5 hours a day, but I have to put in about 2 extra hours doing this every day, so the money I'm being paid isn't really for a 5 hour day, more like 7-8 hours. But time and again, I've heard from my bosses and even FedEx themselves on the rare times when I've gone to safety meetings in the morning - you don't get paid until you get to your first stop. 

Seems really shitty that this company's working model is to depend on drivers to do unpaid labor so they can send the loaders home asap to keep their payroll budget in check. ",post,22,0.96,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedexers/comments/1jhq1xd/can_someone_please_explain_this_to_me/,Chewy
12,Chewy,chewy company,1hhwylm,N/A,2024-12-19,"Another toaster post. Giving up on modern toasters with a wide slot being BIFL, and an article on WHY toasters fail nowadays. I've gone through several $100+ toasters, they're ok at the start, even good, but after a year or two back to inconsistent toasting. Many don't heat enough, so start right out making croutons. Add to that, I make my own bread, so it's not going to FIT in a tiny dualit 4.7"" (120mm) slot at all (dangit, i was ordering one today when I realized that).



Toaster ovens make dried-out toast because they're too slow to heat, not to mention take counter space I don't have. My brevilles work a year or two then are inconsistent. Seems a cheap toaster replaced annually may be the only solution.



But by all means if you've had a toaster you've used a couple of hundred times (I make toast every morning, that's not even a year for me), has a slot that is over 5 3/4"", and still makes toast that's browned on the outside without being dried out, please let me know. If you're just not that particular about your toast being evenly browned/toasted and just want to pipe in with ""a toaster oven is fine"" please save your words, sorry but I'm just wanting better toast than that. I make my own bread, in a bread pan, but I like poofy chewy bread that gets wider than teeny store bread.



Some additional info, yes, modern toasters suck compared to older ones. Here's an article about a study on WHY. In short, the elements are made with crappier materials:

[https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/your-toaster-will-eventually-fail/](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/your-toaster-will-eventually-fail/)

The OSU students found that the heating elements in the Cuisinart and Breville toasters did not contain nickel, which means they were not made of Nichrome. Instead, the elements were made from an iron, chromium, and aluminum alloy (FeCrAl). Nickel is an expensive raw material, so to cut manufacturing costs, companies use aluminum instead and increase the amount of iron in the alloy. But this also makes the heating elements more brittle and less ductile than those in their vintage counterparts, so they’re more delicate and prone to failure.

By contrast, the vintage heating elements are less prone to breakage from the get-go. In their research, the OSU students found this to be true even though the vintage models were previously used (though we don’t know for how long) and the modern toasters were new out of the box.

Edit: maybe I need a shrink not a new toaster lol. I make my own bread and keep getting frustrated over the past decade when the latest expensive toaster stops doing a good job in a year.

I submitted a detailed complaint via their email option on the website to which asupervisor called me. She handled it like a star and I hope she gets a promotion. Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/s/fkCuVau6pi

The tl;dr from my previous post is that Chewy sent me prescription food instead of the correct food with my recurring order. The whole thing involved multiple customer support calls with inconsistent responses and what I consider them holding my dogs food hostage until I corrected their mistake.

Claire, the supervisor from Chewy, was absolutely stellar. She read through my complaint, listened to my audio calls and agreed that Chewy was at fault and mishandled the situation. She apologized and seemed to genuinely care for my concerns. 

Ultimately Claire sent a second package of food along with the original package and issued a full refund. Claire went above and beyond to make things right, even though she could see that I'd already canceled my subscription - a subscription that I do believe I will be renewing thanks to her.

A lot of you got on a high horse saying that this is just business as usual that I should stop being so overly dramatic. Quite a few of you even accused me of lying because this experience did not align with your own.

14,Chewy,chewy.com,1hbwuvj,N/A,2024-12-11,"Bad experiences with Chewy.com? Has anyone else had a terrible experience this last year with Chewy.com? 

I recently ordered dog treats from Chewy during their Black Friday sales. It was a total of 14 bags of treats for around $40. I added enough to my cart to receive several discount codes, a free item and free shipping. I only ever order from Chewy in bulk, so I can benefit from their free shipping for orders over $50. 

This time, I never received my order. When I contacted a representative, they sent a FedEx delivery link with a photo of the delivery- the photo containing my package was not anywhere I recognized. I told this to the representative and they authorized a replacement order to be sent. I received a confirmation email about the replacement order, and an estimated delivery date. 

My replacement package was due to be delivered between Saturday and Tuesday. It is now Wednesday, a whole week and a half after originally ordering my items, and I still have not received them. 

I contacted Chewy today, to inquire about my package again. I was told by the representative that my package was “on its way”, and the representative closed out the chat before I could respond. 

This is not the first time that I have not received my package on time. One of the perks Chewy promotes is that their delivery is within 1-2 days of placing the order. I had ordered dog food earlier this year on two separate occasions and it did not arrive on time. Because of the late delivery, I had to go out and purchase dog food from my local pet store, entirely defeating the purpose of utilizing Chewy.com. 

I understand that it is close to the holidays now, and I am sure that delivery is a nightmare this time of year. However, I paid for a product, even paying more for additional services like free shipping, only to not receive my product or any relevant information regarding it. I don’t understand why Chewy would promote sales and services for their products if they are not able to follow through appropriately.

So I ordered some products from Chewy.com the other day and today when I got the package I noticed both the cat and dog food boxes were open and the cans were rolling around inside the chewy box. I thought cool no big deal but then I remember how I saw multiple reviews of people saying the same thing happens when they get their orders. 

Thinking to myself that’s weird, I started looking at the cans and realized the cans had different expiration dates and even the box they came from had a different expiration date. 

For dog food I ordered Blue Buffalo 6-count Homestyle Recipe (3 cans of chicken, 3 cans of beef). The beef cans are dated for October 15, 2027 and the chicken are dated for July 25th, 2027, also one of the Lot numbers is off from the other 5 cans. And the Blue Buffalo box the cans came in has a date of April 2, 2027.

Cat food I got Fancy Feast Seafood Classic Pâté (24 cans) and all the dates in the cans and box are the same but some of the lot numbers on the cans match and others do not.

It looks like chewy is opening the products they get from these companies and repacking them. The only reason I can think of them doing this is maybe they are buying certain things in bulk and repacking them to diversify their inventory so they can offer a bigger variety of products to the consumers? Or maybe they are repacking older products they have been sitting on to sell them off before the newer stuff? Some of the cans are dented too so maybe they get a discount on dented stuff and resell it to us for normal price?? 

I’m but sure but this feels sketchy and seems like one more thing companies are doing to get over on us. I don’t think they are allowed to repack products but I’m not a lawyer 🤷🏽‍♀️

I’ve looked into automatic feeders, but most of them seem to only work for dry food. Does anyone have tips or hacks for keeping wet food fresh and making sure my cat doesn’t overeat? Or maybe there’s a product out there that solves this? I’d love to hear what’s worked for you!

**Update** on 3/13, summarizing the comments below for **wet feeder**:

29,Chewy,chewy dog,1hlmgmz,N/A,2024-12-24,"Neighbor obsessed with my rural farm animals POSTER UPDATE -2-22-25:

First, I want to thank everyone for reading my post and taking the time to respond. I have read most of the responses.  Because there are so many I haven't been able to read all of them, but intend to.  I am providing an update today:  
  
When I moved here over five years ago it was my intention to have good relationships with all my neighbors. It really upsets me that all this has happened and I'm unable to find a better solution. However, looking back on this I can see where I should have set better boundaries from the beginning. 

A few responses to comments:  
This is not an old demented woman. She is in her 40's, very cognitively intact. However, I do believe she has mental health issues, primarily very needy, over medicated and in need of drama and attention. Although I am not mental health professional, as a Registered Nurse the term 'Borderline Personality Disorder' best describes her behavior and what has been occurring. APS ( Adult Protective Services) won't deal with this issue. 

Husband: Since I have lived her the husband regularly drinks ( and drives). He supports his wife and believes what he is told. Hopefully, after he reads the Attorney's letter with multiple pages listing just some of what she's done over the years he'll be enlightened and stop supporting her behavior. He is generally a very nice, kind 'no confrontation' type of person and has never directly communicated with me int he way she has. Until his recent text to me I thought he was totally neutral in all this.



Since my original posting:

\* I hired an Attorney to send a formal letter of 'Cease and Desist'.  It was a good letter, a copy mailed to both this woman and her husband. It was multiple pages and listed just some of the issues that have occurred over the last five years and demanding they both stop contacting me, making false reports to law enforcements and stop luring my cats  up to their property""  It's only been one week, but I haven't heard anything since and I am hoping I never will. 

Just a few days prior to them receiving this letter I received a cell phone text from the husband ( I have already blocked the woman, husband and all family on Messenger & FB.) Husband wanted to let me know he saw me taking pictures, apparently assuming I was taking pictures of their property?  Also scolded me for being out on my property at night when it's dark. His Text:  "" l saw you taking pictures today in the driveway if you need photos of anything just let me know and I can send them to you. Also creeping around at night with out a flashlight makes it look like a prowler is on your property.  .  .  . Just so your aware several cats are hanging around over here again.    
I was out taking pictures of MY property in preparation for some work done on the property and trees.  He was not home when I was taking pictures with my cell phone. I don't think he understands that his wife has been luring my cats up there, feeding them which is why they are 'hanging around'  
Initially I did not respond. However, felt I needed to say something, especially as I knew the letter from the Attorney was already mailed and on it's way. I responded feeling this is my one and only - and last opportunity to speak up before the letters arrive. ""  I certainly do not need you to provide pictures to me of my own property.   
For the last five years I have gone out at night to check on my livestock and do not need your permission to do so. It is absolutely NONE of your business what I do on my property.  You both need to mind your business.   
Do NOT contact me again EVER for ANYTHING.  Your number is now blocked and I will not be reading or responding to any texts from either of you. 

Per discussion with my Attorney, if anything occurs, any false reports of animal abuse / neglect, find anything more tossed in my pasture or harassment from them, then a Protective Order will be requested

SIGNAGE:  
\*I have correct signage on the fence facing this neighbor: 1. "" NOTICE: Do not touch or feed the animals"" - 2. ""No Trespassing - Property Protected by Video Surveillance, Trespassers Prosecuted"".  I get a lot of deliveries from FedEx, Amazon, Chewy, etc and didn't want my signage to interfere with deliveries so have another sign stating: ""Family, Friends & Deliveries Welcome - All Others Are Trespassing""

\* LURING & FEEDING MY BARN CATS ONTO THEIR PROPERTY:  
The County Animal Control Officer told her to stop putting out food and luring my cats onto her property. However, neither of us can make her stop doing that.  They are free roaming barn cats and it's normal for them to be out and about all over my property. I have one cat that has been missing for well over a month and last seen at their property. The boundary of my property, barn and pasture is less than 50 feet from her back door. The other cat was going up there, however is here at home more and I know she is safe and well. Unfortunately, once the cats have been made welcome by this neighbor feeding them, it's very hard if not impossible to keep them home.

\*BARRIER:  
I purchased the additional fencing to run a secondary fence line about 30 ft inside the existing fence line. This fence will be 6 feet and I have two 50 ft tarps that will hang along that fence line. I need to get some trees trimmed, one removed, etc before I can do that. Also it's February, the ground is frozen and I will need to wait until I can pound in the T-Posts. 

CAMERAS:  
I have additional cameras up in the front of the pasture. Unfortunately, those are battery WYZE and have their limitations. I purchased Netgear Nighthawk Web System consisting of three boxes and have been working this last week to provide internet reception up front to support the cameras. 

FINANCES:  This has taken a bit longer than I would  have liked, however it has all been very costly. Attorney is approx: $1,000, additional fencing well over $1,000, cameras and internet mesh at least another $1,000. I have pulled funds from my IRA for all of this, but feel it's necessary. 

ON A POSTIVE NOTE:  
The rescue I work with has been asking for me to take additional animals. I have been reluctant because of this neighbor's behavior. Since having the Attorney involved and letter sent I am feeling more confident and safer here now.  I have accepted a new llama that came from a neglect situation and he will live out  his life here with the alpacas and other animals. 

I have 'guests' of 7 hens and one (very loud) rooster staying with me temporarily as their owners lost their home to a fire. Once they get established in a new home, this 'flock' will return to their family. In the meantime, they also are getting fresh blueberries and oatmeal, 'bugs' in the afternoon and are very well feed!

I am hoping to arrange some educational events for local school children in the coming months. I have also inquired into 4H and if there are kids that need a place to keep a 4H animal free of charge.  It will be nice to finally be able to utilize this property as I intended when I bought it. 

Thank you again to everyone that has been supportive and offering suggestions.  You are all awesome!  
I probably won't post another update unless something happens. 



===========================

POSTER UPDATE:

PERSONALITY / DEMENTIA: Unfortunately, I don't believe this is an issue of dementia. I wish it was that simple. She is in her early 40's, kids are all grown and out of the house, she stays home, doesn't work because she says her knees bother her. It seems that she always has 'drama' in her life which is made worse because she has too much time on her hands. She is frequently having an issue with her husband who she says is mean to her when he attempts to draw financial boundaries, cut off the Debit Card after she runs it down with daily trips into town for Starbucks, has medical issues she needs help with, etc. It's always something and whatever it is, it makes her the center of attentions.  As a Registered Nurse for over 30 years I've deal with a fair amount of people with issues and this person seems to fall under the term: ""Borderline Personality"" if anything, but not dementia. I have tolerated this behavior only because we're neighbors, I have felt it important to try very hard to keep a good relationship with all of my neighbors and these particular neighbors as I have to share a driveway, etc.  Within months of me moving in here she was trying to get me to let family members move in and asking me for help and money, etc.

SHERIFF / TRESSPASS:  
I requested a Deputy came out to 'Trespass Her' which has been done. I asked them to include not just staying off my property, but no further contact and no feeding animals or putting stuff in the pasture or she would be arrested. I am concerned that she isn't going to just let it rest and waiting for the 'other shoe to drop'.

RESTRAINING ORDER: I have made calls and looking into this. Odds are my particular issue does not fall into any of the accepted categories.

ATTORNEY LETTER:  Out of six Attorneys I left messages for only one called back. She was very nice but declined to help. She did however educate me that spending over $500 on a letter and follow up would do basically nothing as it's a 'threat' and if she violated the demands in the letter I would just have to go and have her arrested which I can already do with the Sheriff Trespassing her.

PASTURE:  
On this property the prior owner used it as a professional dog kennel / breeding facility. It has a huge outbuilding at one end of the pasture and a separate old barn. My house is on the other side of that building separated by a creek and lots of trees so I cannot see what goes on in the pasture from the house. The far end of the pasture has the 3 foot chain link fence, then the neighbors shared driveway, then their backdoor.

BARRIER:  
I appreciate so much everyone's comments and advice. I am purchasing 'Red Barn' Black No Climb 6 foot fence and will be running a line of this fencing about 20-30 feet this side of that initial 3 foot chain link fence. This will create a large 'ally' keeping the animals away from the fence line along with anything she may throw over the fence. Then on suggestion from someone I will put up a black mesh tarp along that entire fenceline to block the view and wind. All total this will cost well over $1,500. I have pulled some money from savings (ROTH) and waiting on that check to fund this fencing

CAMERAS:  
I have about a dozen WYZE cameras between the house and pasture. They generally work well but the motion sensor is only triggered by objects fairly close so it will not trigger and record when folks are way up at that fence line.  I can turn the camera on, sit and watch it, but I need it to act as the other cameras.  I am researching to find a way to get wifi up at that far end of the pasture. I have it half way but it won't pick up that far. I am looking at extenders, etc.  As soon as I do I have ordered additional WYZE cameras that I will put at that far end of the fence line.

I have ordered NetGear Mesh system and it should be here within two weeks. I am familiar with this as I use it at the house. I will put the main router in the pump house with the Starlink Router, a satellite in the red barn which will be closest to that neighbor fence line. This should get me clear and consistent coverage.

MY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY:  
During the last few years as this has been occurring I have honestly felt I was overreacting and afraid to set boundaries, etc. I did 'politely' tell her not to feed the animals, but that lasted a short time.

The many comments you all have taken the time to provide has given me the confidence that I am right and it is appropriate to take actions against her behavior. I've really thought long and hard about all this and there waere many opportunities I had in the past to have the Sheriff Trespass her and was afraid to. That was my responsibility and I failed ( cowardly) There was an 'incident' that I could have handled better, however . . .it was probably for the best it happened. I had been working in the pasture and watching for when the neighbor pulled in. As soon as she did I walked up to the fence line and initiated a conversation ( not really in the best way) I said 'Really (Name) . . you called the Sheriff.  Her response was to yell: ""F\*\*\* Y\*\*' and made a statement about how ALL my animals are dying. This threw me and I've only had two of these animals die in the last 5+ years, the Rescue Org and Vet all said it was not related to anything I did, poor care or nutrition, etc  
Well . . .I lost it.  In my 65 years I have NEVER been this angry at anyone or talked to anyone this way. And I don't recall ever using the language I did that day. I yelled at her: ""You F\*\*\*\*\*\* B\*\*\*\*\* . . you come never my property or animals I will have you arrested. She then yelled back about how all my animals are dying and it's 'suspcious'. Keep in mind I have recents texts from her about how well I take care of my animals and how well fed they are. I make the chickens oatmeal with blueberries and meal worms for goodness sake!.  I continued to yell: ""I have dealt with you mental instability for years and am no longer!  You even look over here and I will have you arrested and make sure you spend time in jail.  Actually.  . . although I could have handled it better . .everything better. . .it sort of felt good to yell at her.

Thanks everyone ( except for the one nasty person) who has been offering helpful advice. I am reading and considering everything. Mostly, you folks have assured me it's OK to set boundaries, trespass her, etc.

===============  
Neighbor obsessed with my rural farm animals, overstepping, trespassing.  
I have lived on my five acre rural property for over six years and have always tried to maintain a good relationship with all surrounding neighbors. I have senior rescue animals ( alpaca, chickens, etc) that I have adopted and it is anticipated they will live out their lives on my property. The rescue organization visits my property as well as a Veterinarian. My animals are well taken care of.  
I have an older female stay at home neighbor who is overly involved in my animals, has come onto my property to feed them without permission including going into my barn and pulling hay to feed my llama without permission. )The hay she pulled had been set aside as it was contaminated with cleaning fluid and needed to be destroyed.) She has also thrown food, soup bones, toys over the pasture fence for my new LGD ( Livestock Guardian Dog) / GP (Great Pyrenees) after being told. Behavior includes sending me multiple texts how my alpacas are upset that it is raining and she is singing to them, my chicken is in distress (it was laying an egg). I have texts from her confirming she is feeding my barn cats and encouraging them to stay at her property and I am having difficulty keeping them home, then telling her husband I am neglecting them.  
I have in the past included and allowed her to visit the animals in an attempt to keep a good neighborly relationship. however she is unable to maintain normal boundaries in her behavior and emotional involvement with my animals  
Recently I had an alpaca pass away for the first time. This is a very difficult time even though anticipated. This neighbor, who knew nothing of the details called the local sheriff to report me for animal abuse / neglect.  I did confront this neighbor whose only response was : ""F\*\*\* You"".  
I have had enough and no longer feel it necessary or even possible to maintain a good neighborly relationship. I am exploring options from having her trespassed by the Sheriff, having an attorney send a letter of warning ( harassment, etc), some sort of protective / restraining order.  
I should also mention that as we share a driveway and their back door is closer to my pasture then my own home is, in the name of 'neighborly friendship' I have been there for her to listen to her marital issues, given her money, etc. She is currently driving impaired on a daily basis ( prescription meds) and has totaled two vehicles in the last few months.  
I'm looking for any advice on how to deal with this woman, create boundaries, keep her from throwing food and toys in my pasture and calling my animals ( cats ) to her property and feeding them.

PASTURE:  
This property used to be a professional dog kennel / breeding facility. It has a huge outbuilding at one end of the pasture. My house is on the other side of that building separated by a creek and lots of trees so I cannot see what goes on in the pasture from the house.

Then on suggestion from someone I will put up a black mesh tarp to block the view and wind. This will create an ally and keep the animals from going up to the edge of the fence.

SHERIFF / TRESSPASS:  
I called, asked and a Deputy came out to 'Trespass Her'. I asked them to include not just staying off my property, but no further contact and no feeding animals or putting stuff in the pasture or she would be arrested. I am concerned that she isn't going to just let it rest.

Having spent a solid month testing Milk-Bone 10829274006177 Soft & Chewy Dog Treats, Beef & Filet Mignon Recipe, I can confidently provide some insights you’ll want to hear if you’re considering these for your dog. My furry companion, Max, a middle-aged Labrador with a penchant for tasty snacks, and my sister’s toy Poodle, Bella, put these treats through the wringer. Here's everything you need to know.

**Texture and Flavor – Dog Approved**

The first thing that struck me about these treats was their soft, chewy texture. Max usually prefers to gnaw on harder treats, but these were perfect for him, especially after a recent dental cleaning. Bella, being a smaller dog with a more delicate jaw, also had no issues chomping on these. The fact that they are made with real chuck roast and are fortified with 12 essential vitamins and minerals was a bonus for me as a pet owner. The beef and filet mignon flavor must be a hit because I couldn't get Max to sit still the moment I popped the lid. Surprisingly, even picky Bella wagged her tail impatiently every time I reached for the canister.

[Ready for Milk-Bone 10829274006177? Explore Amazon pricing here.](https://petof.com/p/b006hka6ii/)

**Packaging and Portioning**

Another aspect I appreciated was the convenient 25-ounce canister. It’s sturdy and resealable, keeping the treats fresh for weeks. With Max being approximately 80 pounds, I usually give him one full treat, and for Bella, a quarter of one suffices. They’re easy to break into smaller pieces, which ensures I can control the portion size depending on how “good” my pups have been that day.

**Favorable Attributes**

- Soft and chewy texture suits dogs of all sizes and ages.  
- Made with real beef for a more authentic flavor.  
- Fortified with 12 vitamins and minerals, promoting general health.  

**Feeding Directions and Ingredients**

The instructions are straightforward: these treats are designed to be fed as part of a healthy diet. For smaller breeds, breaking them into tinier pieces is recommended. I like that Milk-Bone emphasizes moderation and insists on monitoring your pet while treating. However, it’s worth checking the ingredient list for dogs with allergies. While most dogs are fine with the formula, those highly sensitive to beef or certain grains might not react as favorably. Thankfully, Max and Bella had no issues.

**Shortcomings**

- High aroma might not suit owners who dislike strong-smelling treats.  
- Might seem overly soft to those who prefer crunchy treats for dental benefits.  

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

As much as these treats work as rewards for good behavior, they also shined during training sessions. Their pliable nature allowed me to stuff them into puzzle toys for mental stimulation, and breaking them into tiny bits worked wonders when teaching Bella a new trick. I even used them to help Max adjust to wearing his new harness during our morning walks.

**Direct Competitors**

Looking at similar treat options on the market, Blue Buffalo Blue Bits is a rival many dog owners might recognize. The Blue Bits are soft and contain real chicken, but they don't have as broad a flavor profile as Milk-Bone’s beef and filet mignon recipe. Milk-Bone edges out with its slightly larger package size for a comparable cost, but Blue Bits might appeal to those seeking grain-free alternatives. On the other hand, Greenies Pill Pockets are softer but focused more on packaging pills rather than as a general treat. It really depends on your specific needs, though Max would argue Milk-Bone’s flavor wins every time.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering the generous 25-ounce canister and the wholesome ingredients, I’d say these treats fall into the “bang for the buck” category. Some high-end dog snacks are priced significantly higher for smaller quantities, but these deliver great quality at a reasonable cost. I’ve noticed the brand has been trustworthy over the years, and the long shelf life is another weight off my shoulders when stocking up.

44,Chewy,chewy cat,1iah1ib,N/A,2025-01-26,"My cat won’t stop vacuuming I recently got a robot vacuum for Christmas and was worried about it scaring our 1 year old cat. The day we set it up, my cat followed the vacuum around for hours playing with it. 

The vacuum is suppose to charge itself, and then vacuum at scheduled times. As soon as the vacuum went back to it’s charging dock the cat kept playing with it until he eventually realized that not only do the buttons make a fun beeping noise, but they also make the vacuum move around. 

It’s been almost a month and my cat still turns on the vacuum for hours everyday. Every time we send it back to its charging station, the cat uses the buttons to put in back in cleaning mode. I wake up in the middle of the night to find the cat vacuuming the bedroom if I forgot to cover the buttons at night. 

While I appreciate how clean he keeps the floors, I’m starting to worry we may have to sell the vacuum. 

Edit: thank you to everyone who pointed out that my cat may be using the vacuum to fulfill his enrichment needs. I got a Chewy gift card for Christmas, so I am going to look into some motorized or interactive cat toys, or at least some that are more stimulating then our current ones (we have the typical stuff like plastic balls with bells, fake mice, catnip filled toys, etc. Not much that is interactive).

47,Chewy,chewy cat,1j2phlj,N/A,2025-03-03,"All 5 of my cats got extremely sick from purina classic paté. 5 ER visits so far. Need advice for food so they can stay alive. Edit AGAIN: She has finally ate about 3 hours ago and is doing well so far. Her son’s second xray came back and he no longer has pancreatitis and the inflammation is nearly completely gone.  He is back to normal, eating, peeing, pooping, cuddling. She is acting better now that she has ate, she wants more but I know to wait she can’t eat everything at once. She also will have a checkup tomorrow or the next day to get another xray to see how she’s improved compared to her son. Also, I am extremely grateful to the people who gave me actual advice. And to the people who have either messaged me or commented dealing with the same situation I’m so sorry and I can only hope your babies are going to be okay, report it to the FDA, to Purina and if it was chewy like most of us, get a refund for it. I’m unable to reply to anyone and can’t physically or emotionally deal with going through negative Reddit vets who do not even know the whole story or anyone else’s or hasn’t even researched. Very easy to search it up, so many people dealing with this batch causing the same illness in their cat(s). Also, the first cat to start showing severe sickness has been fine the past 8 days or more since getting help & cutting him off from the food. 

Edit to add: I do not care to argue the cause, considering timeline and who ate what and how much and many other factors I don’t have time to explain I need my cat to eat, 4 vets, 2 clinics and hundreds of others going through this right now with this batch all know the cause. Even purina does or they wouldn’t be paying peoples medical bills, give me advice on what to feed my dying cats PLEASE. I do not care to argue on if purina would recall fancy feast, they’ve made cats sick last year and there was NO RECALL. They’re paying everyone’s vet bills and refunding all the food. To my knowledge, hundreds have reported this and my 3 vets have, my brothers vet has, and other owners and vets dealing with this have. Still no recall. This isn’t new for purina to not recall. Please just give me advice on what food is like crack for cats so my babies who are struggling to recover can eat. Thank you. 

So the past 2 weeks have been horrific. If you feed your cat purina fancy feast wet food id steer clear from all of it but specifically the classic pâtés. I am exhausted from 2 weeks of being up 24/7 to try and save my cats, but it started out with either lethargy & disinterest in food and or projectile vomiting & throwing up over and over and over again. Duke threw up over 30 times. After they all ran this course including blood in their puke at some point due to inflammation of their gastrointestinal system, they would not eat or drink anything. These cats are cats who are ALWAYS hungry to the point of it being annoying. Well that all stopped. Their X-rays showed their ENTIRE gastrointestinal system from top to bottom to be EXTREMELY inflamed. Dx with severe IBD & pancreatitis. Serial number 43 is what’s really made them sick. I won’t continue to go on because I need something my 3 cats will eat whom are still recovering.

I have given them over 30 plus choices of food so far. Nothing. Even with cerenia and an appetite stimulant, they will not eat. They don’t want boiled chicken, no tuna, aq no treats, 20 different cans of food of all different types of meat, nothing. 10 different packages of wet junk food squeezable pouches and 6 pouches of gravies& broth. Only 1 choice of dry food. Nothing. 

This will be nalas 7th day without food ( yes she went to the ER and got some hydration & other things 2 days ago) she will not eat anything. What’s a food that’s like crack for them? Dry food or wet either works she needs to eat. None of my cats like those go gurt like pouch treats before and currently. Obviously I will not be giving them fancy feast, they don’t want it either before finding out it was the cause they knew something was wrong with it :( ",post,287,0.86,429,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1j2phlj/all_5_of_my_cats_got_extremely_sick_from_purina/,Chewy

Curious what homemade foods would pair with the urinary restrictions? My cat has been on CD urinary food for years and we realized that after enough time passes--she simply gets tired of eating specific brands/flavors. We started with Hills..whose options are chicken & oceanfish. After a few years of back and forth she wasn't finishing half a meal portion. We checked with the vet to confirm this wasn't a health issue and just pickiness. So I switched to a Purina alternative that had more gravy and solid chunks which she loved immediately (1 of the 2 flavors anyways). After 6 months of this she's getting sick of Purina. The vet suggested boiled chicken and sure enough she ate that up...but that can't be a full replacement as it doesn't have the same nutritional value. At this point I think we need to just buy as many different brands as possible and switch them up daily. The only issue is Chewy has limited options.

59,Chewy,chewy order,1giyqrb,N/A,2024-11-03,"AITA for telling my sister she's not allowed to bring her homemade food to Thanksgiving because her cooking is ruining the meal? Every year, our family does a big Thanksgiving dinner, and we all typically bring a dish or two. My sister, who’s a lovely person in every other way, insists on cooking something homemade every time. The issue? She’s… not a great cook. And I don’t mean just “not great”—I mean she has somehow managed to turn classic dishes into borderline inedible creations.

For context, last Thanksgiving, she showed up with her “special recipe” stuffing that was over-seasoned with random spices like cinnamon and cardamom. It was dry, and the flavors were confusing and totally off for stuffing. Only one person took a small bite, and the rest went untouched. Another year, she brought a green bean casserole that had some kind of strange, chewy texture—she later admitted she used coconut milk and almond flour “to experiment.” No one wanted seconds of that, either.

This year, I’m hosting Thanksgiving. Since I’m responsible for putting it all together, I wanted to keep the menu consistent so that people could actually enjoy a cohesive meal. I thought I’d avoid drama by asking her to bring non-food items instead—like wine, soda, or even some flowers. I explained to her (very kindly, I thought) that I just wanted to make things easy and streamlined, and I’d handle the main dishes. But she didn’t take it well.

She got offended and told me I was being “controlling” and “shutting her out” of the family gathering. She then accused me of making her feel inadequate and said that Thanksgiving is about everyone contributing, not me deciding what’s “acceptable.” I told her that everyone appreciates her effort, but that she could contribute in other ways and still be part of it. She doubled down and said she’s bringing her “famous” green bean casserole whether I like it or not.

Now, my mom and a couple of other family members have chimed in, saying I should just let her bring whatever she wants because “it’s Thanksgiving” and “it’s the thought that counts.” They’re acting like I’m committing some huge offense by wanting the food to be enjoyable for everyone and not have random experimental dishes that no one will eat.

But I feel like I’m just trying to keep the meal enjoyable and, frankly, edible. I don’t think it’s wrong to want guests to actually enjoy the food, especially since I’m putting in a lot of effort to host. Am I really being unreasonable here? AITA?

UPDATE: Alright, well, things have escalated fast. Thanks to everyone who offered advice—I tried to compromise, but it’s already turning into a whole thing, and Thanksgiving is still a few weeks away.

After our last conversation, my sister was being pretty cagey about what she planned to make, so I reached out to my mom, hoping she could help smooth things over. Instead, she got defensive, saying I’m “overthinking” and that it’s just one dish. I told her I wasn’t sure it was just one dish anymore, especially after hearing about my sister’s grocery haul (including canned oysters and edible glitter).

Then my mom let slip that my sister has been “hard at work” on some “creative menu” she’s planning as her “Thanksgiving surprise.” Apparently, she’s been telling the family group chat (which I wasn’t included in, by the way) that I’m being “controlling” and that she wants to “expand everyone’s palate” with something “truly unique.”

To top it off, my cousin sent me a screenshot from the group chat where my sister said she’s bringing not one but three dishes to Thanksgiving now. She’s calling them her “Thanksgiving Trio Experience,” complete with their own place settings and little menu cards she’s designing. I’m officially panicking because I have no idea what she’s planning to serve, and from what I’ve heard, it’s not remotely traditional.

At this point, half the family thinks I’m overreacting, while the other half is texting me with things like, “Is she really bringing glittered sweet potatoes?” I feel stuck—if I try to control it any more, I’m the bad guy, but if I don’t, Thanksgiving might turn into a tasting event for my sister’s avant-garde cooking.

So yeah, Thanksgiving is weeks away, and it’s already become a family spectacle. I don’t know whether to brace myself or just preemptively order pizza.",post,14389,0.95,5728,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1giyqrb/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_not_allowed_to/,Chewy

They have always been responsive and accommodating, but it is the personal, human touch that truly sets them apart.

A few years ago, my family lost a pet, and we needed to stop the auto-ship for their food. Chewy immediately took care of the situation, no questions asked. But what really touched me was their kind suggestion that I donate the food order that was already in transit. It was a thoughtful gesture. A few days later, I received a beautiful bouquet of flowers at my home, along with sincere condolences from the entire Chewy family.

Recently, my dog, Molly, has been struggling with mobility issues (hopefully short-term). I bought stairs from Chewy to help her get onto the bed more easily, but Molly had other plans and made it clear that the stairs were not going to work for her! I contacted Chewy to arrange a return, and before I even finished the chat, they had already refunded my money. They once again suggested donating the stairs to a shelter or clinic.

This level of customer service is truly extraordinary, and I want to publicly share my appreciation for Chewy. Their kindness and responsiveness have left an impression on me.

I've:

* Sent multiple emails
* Reached out on Instagram
* Tried messaging on Facebook
* Even attempted Twitter

Radio silence. Not even an automated response.

Meanwhile, companies like Chewy get it right. Need help? Just call their direct phone number and talk to a real person who actually wants to help. What a concept!

I understand businesses get busy, but having ZERO way to speak to a human is unacceptable, especially for a company selling premium furniture. What if there's an issue with assembly? What if parts are missing? In my case, it's something trivial that any customer service rep could solve in minutes - if only I could reach one.

The bed frame I ordered isn't cheap - their website says they're all about quality and customer satisfaction. Well, I'm not feeling very satisfied right now.

Thuma, if you're reading this - please take a page from Chewy's book. Give your customers a way to actually reach you. A phone number. An email that gets responses. Something. Anything.

Has anyone else had this experience with Thuma? How did you finally get through to them?

Our Chewy autoship for our 6 month supply of flea and heartworm preventatives came up and we got a notice from Chewy saying that our vet is requiring we mail a prescription. We were like huh? this has never been the case. So upon calling our vet they said they stopped doing 3rd party sellers (didn't feel the need to warn their clients with an email, but okay.) Fine, pricing appeared nearly identical, we will fill it through them. Attempt an order through them, but get a notice that no we can't get the heartworm Rx because our dog needs yearly bloodwork first (could have just said that the first time we called.) Fine, we bring him in. A $500 vet bill later, I ask if the heartworm order will go through now and they say I have to re-order on their online platform. Fine, I do just that. I get yet ANOTHER ding from the vet that the order has been denied because we can only order a max dose of 3 - which is literally MORE expensive than just getting the 6 month supply - what we have ALWAYS done the 5 years we've had our dog and have been going there.

We like our vet but what the eff is this runaround?? What was once $72/year is now going to be $180/year all in. I have never complained about the cost of a vaccine, exam, or other services from my vet but this just seems like a slap to customers so they can profit more off of measly chewable tablets. I can't even throw in the towel and just go physically pick up the Rx to mail it to Chewy because it's a 3 dose max fill which Chewy doesn't even offer.

Does your vet limit your dog's monthly Rx - like is there a real reason I'm not aware of? Is this worth switching vets over?

EDIT/UPDATE: Receptionist said it appears the reasoning is that because my dog is due for his Lepto/Bord vaccines in July is why the doctor only made it a 3-month prescription. The girl was nice and I didn't want to Karen out on her, but I inquired what the checkup had to do with anything when we've never been late on our vaxes, and have always done the 6 month supply - and she said she'd have to leave a note for the doctor about adjusting the prescription. It's possible the doctor didn't know the pricing for the 3-month and 6-month are the same, because the receptionist was surprised to hear it, and was waiming to just discuss or refill the Rx when we met for our annual exam. Hopefully a quick fix, but annoying nonetheless that it's taken beyond 10 days to just get my dog his dang ivermectin tablets lol.

Warning: rant. I watched a couple of youtubers who visited the shows in person and the general consensus was that ADCC put up a good show. I 100% belief ADCC did, especially compared to the last show. Chewy made an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK-QUMRDYX0&t=908s) about the event, but in his mailing-list email complained about being attacked by ""The Cult of Craig"" when saying anything positive about ADCC. It is a legit point and I get where he is coming from.

But I also think that they underestimate how much of the hate is coming from the online Flowgrappling ""experience"": cameras on the wrong mat, commentators commenting on another match, streaming issues, ads during matches (whytf are there ads for a paid service), etc. There is an established history how expensive and shit Flograpping service is. People are fed up with it, but never had an alternative. The main BJJ event of the year(s) was always behind this horrible paywell. Which was also bad for the sport in general, because only hardcore fans would have access to it. The authoritarian arrogance of Mo and the ADCC organisation in general hasn't helped either. And every year it also felt more and more like the Gordon Ryan cult show with even made-up medals specifically for that homeless-people-deserve-to-die-in-the-snow-if-they-dont-work-hard piece of shit.

In the end we as fans felt ripped off, choice-less, bend-over the table and fucked in the ass. You enjoy BJJ? You better suck on this American flag abusing, Trump worshipping, oh-no-my tummy, I-need-special-treatment-and-rules, chest-thumping, taint of a baby-man dickhole like the rest of us and pay the yearly fee if you want to see your favorite grapplers go at it.

And now CJI comes along and makes it about the sport, about the athletes, about charity. It is available for everyone *in the world* to see for free. And while they do that, they make it fun and exiting by causally re-inventing the game in a brilliant matter.

So no shit people have strong feelings about this. I have (obviously).  And yes, we live in a social-media age of polarization and having to choose a camp, a person, a personality, but I think in this case, this is what happens if you treat your customers like shit.

Since I have a bad back I'd like the drivers to deliver these large boxes to my door instead of the package locker; that way I won't have to struggle to carry heavy boxes to and from my car. Customer Service at Chewy suggested I go to Fedex Package Manager to give Fedex my delivery instructions.

Unfortunately I went to regular [Fedex.com](http://Fedex.com) by mistake, where it told me to create an account. I began entering my information but when it asked for my credit card to pay for shipments I realized I had made a mistake and tried to back out. I couldn't find a button to Cancel. Now I'm in Fedex Hell!

I'm receiving relentless Fedex SPAM telling me to finish creating the account. They don't provide an UNSUBSCRIBE link in these unsolicited, unwanted emails. How is that considered good business practice?

Fedex website FAQ says that to delete an account I must call Tech Support at 1.877.339.2774. The woman at Tech Support kept saying ""Let me make sure I understand you. You're having trouble creating a shipping label, right?""

Eventually I started losing my patience. She transferred me to Customer Service, where after half an hour of explaining and arguing, I was informed that because I hadn't finished creating an account, there was no way to delete it. The only way they can delete my data is for me to finish creating the bloody account by ENTERING MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. I'm not going to do that. I shouldn't have to!

I said, ""Look up my email address. Fedex has it in the system because they keep spamming me to finish creating the account.""

He said ""We can't trace you through your email address. Only your account number or phone number.""

But because I didn't finish creating my account they don't have either number on file.

Since he wasn't Tech Support and couldn't help me, I asked repeatedly to be transferred to a Tech Support SUPERVISOR, only to be told that he couldn't transfer me because, without an account, the supervisor won't accept the call.  ARRRRRRGHHHHHHH!!!!!!

90,Chewy,chewy customer service,1jd5cpd,N/A,2025-03-17,"I feel like buying multiple heavy items as a customer is similar to leaving your table extremely dirty or not tipping at a restaurant Firstly, about the Chewy boxes, water packs, etc.I really don't care about lifting a few heavy boxes. Big deal. It's some extra exercise under your belt. But I still feel it's an uncourteous thing to do regardless on behalf on the consumer, especially considering most people buying these things can easily just pick it up from 2 aisles down at the local Aldi's or whatever, drop it in their cart whenever they get their weekly groceries and take it in themselves. ""Oh but a handicapped person might live there"" Fuck off. I can assure you, a handicap person in a wheelchair is not living at this house with 3 flights of stairs that you need to scale just to reach the front porch. Worst case, they have a caretaker that brings in all this shit anyway. 


I see a lot of the arguments against people who are clearly frustrated with multiple 24-packs of water or Chewy boxes, etc are typically ""it's your job why are you complaining?"" or ""go find another job if you don't like it"" -- but I feel like you can apply that to any other kind of service where you can easily make the workers' lives of that service unnecessarily harder by doing certain things, like leaving a mess at your table where it is convention to clean up after yourself, or refusing to stack the plates such that it's easier for the waiter or waitress to pick them up. No, it's not really illegal to not clean up after yourself. Nobody is going to punish you for it if you don't. The same with tipping. But why make their lives more difficult than it already has to be? Yes, it's the workers responsibility and yes you are paying for the service and giving money to the company that pays their wages, but still.


The other thing is that people absolutely hold the right to complain about their jobs because we are all thrusted into this position not necessarily always by choice; we are born in a debt-based economy with insanely high housing prices and life circumstances that may be less than ideal which lead us to working a dead end job, at least hopefully until something better is found. So the response of ""don't like what you do? Go find something else."" is wild to me because name one person that actually enjoys their job to the point that they would do it for free? You can't. If these people had 10mil dollars in their bank account and the means to doing whatever they want do you think they would be working at the place they are currently? No lmfao. The truth is that the vast majority of people don't even like their job and resent the fact they're going to be working at said job they deeply and secretly dislike for the rest of their waking life but instead of acknowledging that themselves and doing something about it they feel more comfortable not doing anything and then therefore decide they have to shit on other people. It's a ""if I have to put up with it, so do other people"" sense of unjustified unfairness that I think some people have that compels them to treat others with a lack of decency.

Chewy screwed up a super important order where they basically shipped an empty box, then tried to justify it by shipping what was missing as a ""replacement"". Well, what was missing was literally all of our Mama Queen's Cat Food.

You see, she just had four kittens. On Mother's Day, no less. These cute little fur balls are a mere four days old. I was counting on her food arriving on time--she's newly adopted, we've barely had her two weeks--but alas, Chewy'd abysmal failure--and then their customer service's complete and utter indifference --meant driving though a torrential downpour in a severe thunderstorm at 11am to our local PetSmart to get some Royal Canin Mother & Babycat Mousse. 

Coming home, she was ravenously hungry, poor girl. So, I was thinking, rather than continue to be angry and miserable, instead I'm gonna share some pics of these adorable little guys. Times like this, when the world feels shitty, it's nice that there are some things that are still constant in the world. 

Like a young mama cat, and her four kittens. Enjoy. ",post,15,1,9,https://i.redd.it/7kw74thsks0f1.jpeg,Chewy
92,Chewy,chewy customer service,1f5hkze,N/A,2024-08-31,"any recommendations for wet foods like tiki cat after dark? (no fish!) TLDR recommendations for wet food like tiki cat, I like that I can tell it's chicken just by looking at it. Dry food recs also welcome. PSA check your tiki cat I got a bad batch! dry and wet! And I'm sad about all this

I've never been able to find another food like it. It looks like a can of canned chicken, because thats exactly what it is. I genuinely can't find anything like it. Acana looks similar but it's still not it. Dry food recommendations are also welcome.

And PSA, CHECK YOUR TIKI CAT! is your cat having tummy troubles? Did you just open a new bag of wet food or a new box of broths? Check the food. I just got a bad batch of both the wet and dry food. Photo to show you. The one that looks good smelled rancid. And I've done tiki cat for years, I know it's smells very strong. This was rancid. And, well, the other one is GREY.

One more offshoot this one's a TMI I contacted chewy about it to get them to check their stock and I don't think they took me seriously either time I chatted with them on the app. They gave me confusing return instructions and I tried to clarify things and they got rude from there on out, I sent photos with the order number clearly there and the items under it and they kept telling me I was sending them the wrong number and then they kept changing numbers. I'm not going to lie I have never ever been treated badly by a chewy customer service person and it really wasn't that bad but they're always so nice and I wasn't expecting it, ngl I'm crying because this plus feeling like I failed my babies giving them bad food, I just 😭 sorry for ranting it's midnight and I can't cry to anyone else. Hoping other cat parents will understand. Thank you if you read this far.",post,9,0.91,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1f5hkze/any_recommendations_for_wet_foods_like_tiki_cat/,Chewy

Then I hear nothing from tracking other than on a Fed Ex truck. Once again placed on a fedex truck and delivered to the door in a fedex box. The package was originally from Chewy.
 I open the box to find the contents of one of my dry pet foods wet. I call chewy only to find out that My pet food has been contaminated and my pet cleaner is missing. Chewy customer service and forums made that the pet cleaner was placed in my pet food items!
There is no cleaner in the box,the box is in a fedex box instead of chewy. There is no identification that the box was even damaged on my tracking information.
There is no identification that the box was even damaged on tracking  info.
 So, basically someone at Fed Ex repackaged the items, spilled the cleaner inside of my pet food and left the spilled cleaner out and delivered. I mean you can't really re package Something that is spilled out on another item,right?
I am glad that I was able to identify that the pet food was contaminated before my pets becomes sick or died.  How could a company just deliver something contaminated and spilled?

95,Chewy,chewy customer service,1iz3hy6,N/A,2025-02-26,"Chewy isn't dependable I have been a faithful Chewy customer for approx 7 years. All 7 of those years have been on autoship. I have 4 large dogs that eat 6 cups a day so it's nice to set it on every 3 weeks and forget about it. Well everything was fine until Dec 2024. For some reason I never got my order. I looked at my app and the order stated shipped 11 days prior. Now I live less than 20 miles from the Chewy plant so I found this odd. I called them and they apologized and stated it was on its way. I had to call back them back a week later to ask where the order was. I was already out of dog food so I had to buy another bag which was almost $60. This was after I paid the $92 for the autoship. Ultimately Chewy credited me $20 to ""cover"" the $60 bag........... after several more days I called a 3rd time asking where the dog food was because the $60 bag was now gone. At that time they stated they didn't know where it was and that they would send me a ""free"" bag of dog food. Well it wasn't free because I never got the bag I paid for. I also got this bag almost 5 weeks late. Fast forward to today 2/26/25. I went to feed my dogs and noticed their food was almost gone. I went to grab the new bag which should have been delivered already and I noticed I didn't receive it. I looked at the app and noticed that they BLOCKED my autoship order. I called then asking why my order was blocked and she would only say they needed to verify the order information. That's strange, Ive been with chewy for almost a decade and not once have they ever needed to verify anything. Actually my order/my credit card and my address haven't changed. I feel this is retaliation for calling in and complaining about the missing dog food. I also feel the service at Chewy has gone down hill the last year. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I'm disappointed that I trusted Chewy to follow through with ensuring I had my dog food (since I have it on autoship) but Chewy failed. Since I can no longer depend on Chewy I had to cancel and find a new company that I can depend on. I will also share my experiences with anyone who will listen.

96,Chewy,chewy customer service,1fj8a56,N/A,2024-09-17,"Marley Spoon Review: A Saga of Chaos, Delays, and Chewy Chicken 

Let me tell you a tale of culinary woe, my friends. My family has been around the block when it comes to meal delivery services. We’re seasoned veterans of the game, having dined with Hello Fresh, Green Chef, Blue Apron—you name it, we’ve tried it. And for the most part, we’ve survived unscathed. But then… along came Marley Spoon. Oh, Marley Spoon, how we had hopes for you. How we were wrong. So, so wrong.

See, we’re a busy family. We’ve got sports, travel, and a whole lot of things that make meal planning essential. Grocery shopping is a dangerous game of spontaneous purchases that we like to avoid at all costs. So when we place an order with a scheduled delivery date, we kind of expect that date to be accurate, you know? Well, our first order never showed up. Nada. Zilch. As we waited for our precious box of ingredients, a delightful little email pinged its way into our inbox. “Your delivery is delayed. Could be 24 hours.” Oh, could it now? Well, thank you, Marley Spoon. So, should we plan for two meals now? Do we need to start Googling “how to make a meal out of stale crackers and sadness”? And what about the meat? Will it arrive cold enough, or is this the food delivery version of Russian roulette with our digestive systems?

Fast forward to the next day—box arrives, late as all hell, just in time to miss dinner. Perfect. At this point, we’re already hangry. The kids are eyeing the cats like we are the illegal immigrants from Hati everyone is up in arms about . So, we call customer service, hoping to salvage what’s left of our sanity and cancel the service. But wait—there’s more! Unlike literally every other service, Marley Spoon decided to throw all the ingredients into the box like a frat house after-party. No separation by meal, no logic, just chaos in cardboard. I spent longer sorting out the contents of this box than I would’ve spent walking aimlessly through the grocery store, wondering why I came in for eggs and left with an inflatable pool.

And just when you think the nightmare’s over, guess what? I noticed they charged me for the next box before I even received the first one. Classic move. So, I call again, and the lovely customer service agent basically says, “Tough luck, dude. The box is already in production.” Oh, is it? Cool, thanks for the heads-up before swiping my card like a thief in the night. Who charges a card before the item even ships? Marley Spoon does, folks. Marley. Spoon.

To add insult to injury, they offered me a whopping $45 credit for the delayed box. Gee, thanks. That’ll definitely make up for the fact that I now have to refuse delivery on the next box and fight my bank to stop payment. But wait, the worst part? The food. Dry, chewy chicken that made me question my life choices. If you’re into bland meals and rubbery meat, congrats—this service is perfect for you.

In conclusion, Marley Spoon is a chaotic mess disguised as a meal delivery service. They’ve got the delivery timing of a sloth on a leisurely stroll and the packaging skills of someone who’s never seen a box before. Do yourself a favor—stick to grocery shopping or literally any other service unless you want to experience food delivery purgatory.",post,10,0.67,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/marleyspoon/comments/1fj8a56/marley_spoon_review_a_saga_of_chaos_delays_and/,Chewy

For me I buy for personal consumption/sharing on the plane. For others, I would reconsider picking up last minute gifts for rellies. 

I think this is my 3rd time where I've gotten defective/spoiled high end brands like Manoa, Tcho and Lonohana at various gift shops. Duty Free, the news stand and I forget what. 

The thing with those types of chocolates is they don't have stabilizers mixed in. So they're pretty temperature sensitive. The outside is covered in white haze if you're lucky. Or less unlucky. One of the brands was so bad the outside of the bar was a solid white haze.  The bar itself crumbled into little pieces and the individual pieces were waxy/chewy. 

I contacted one of the brands customer service with a lot number. That batch was pretty current. So something in the handling at HNL is off enough that the super perishable stuff goes south. Hawaiian Host/Kona are probably okay-ish. They likely have enough stabilizers like paraffin to tolerate whatever time in the sun or warehouse these things are going through en route.

98,Chewy,chewy customer service,1jyulgl,N/A,2025-04-14,"Pet Libro Water Fountain ??????? Hi,
I was on Pet Libro’s site and read this on their warranty section:

“For products purchased directly from an authorized retailer other than the Petlibro official website, such as Amazon and Chewy, the Petlibro customer support team will only provide maintenance service. Contact the above mentioned platform for return and refund service.”

Does everyone who owns Pet Libro know this? It sounds like you can’t get warranty service at all if you buy from Amazon or Chewy? And I see nowhere that lists authorized retailers? One person on Reddit warned not to buy Pet Libro from Amazon saying theirs are junk. 

I found that quote on Pet Libro’s site AFTER ordering a Dock Station listed by Amazon as only having a cosmetic scratch. It arrived yesterday with no filter, no power cord adaptor, no brush, and no manual??!! Now I have to return this disaster.

I decided I would contact Pet Libro to ask questions before re-ordering. I wanted to know the difference in operation between the Dock Station Battery model when plugged in and not using battery motion detecting function, if any, and the Stainless model. Plus, the Dock Station manual online says it has only a 12-month warranty but on Pet Libro’s  website in product description it says it has a 24-month warranty??? 

But there is NO in person phone or chat support. I was forced to email. I did get a quick reply from “April”, who did not answer my questions and then ghosted me when I replied asking the questions yet again.

Anyone have any feedback on Pet Libro? Why do so many sites list this company as the best???? Is there any reliable water fountain, a company with great customer service  AND a great product out there? Can’t seem to find any on Amazon that have an 80% rating and most are in the 60’s approval range. 

Thanks for any help. My cat is ill with crystals and I really need a water fountain to help him recover.

I hate that Chewy uses FedEx for delivery!!  We had so many issues in the past with FedEx not delivering packages.  Thankfully Chewy has excellent customer service and they have always taken care of it.  Then we got a new FedEx driver and she was awesome -- delivered on time and to the right house!  I no longer had to wander our townhouse complex looking for my Chewy box.

I just ordered my dog more of her prescription dog food and it's been delayed three times now.  I hope we don't run out before FedEx finally decides to deliver our Chewy box -- my dog is on a kidney diet, so it's not like I can just run to the pet store and get more.  It's always been delivered a day or two after placing my order, but I still leave a buffer in case it's delayed.  At this point, I'm guessing they lost my dog's food.

Hoping that the job interview I had today actually leads to a job so I can buy an extra bag of food to prepare for FedEx f***-ups.  It's been hard enough lately, and FedEx is just making it harder.  I'm also kind of pissed at Chewy for continuing to use FedEx, and at my vet for not having any prescription foods at their office.

My FedEx driver started leaving all packages by the mailbox next to the busy road. literally on the edge of the road. Doesn't matter if it's raining or not, he still leaves it sitting in the mud without a plastic wrap. Nothing like breaking open a 70 pound chewy box, in the rain, next to a busy road at night because I can't load the whole 70lbs into my Jeep. He is doing the same with my neighbor. I went to the local FedEx store and was told that they're independent contractors so there was nothing he could do. I called FedEx to file a complaint. I got a guy that was actually helpful and took all the information along with tracking numbers. He obviously talked to my driver because it got way, way worse. now he won't deliver at all.  One of my deliveries is a weekly delivery from a food service, Hungryroot. It comes every Wednesday and it's obvious what it is. Well, Wednesday he did not deliver it and tracking showed that it wasn't delivered because ""recipient not available"".  This package does not require signature, never has. Obviously, he wasn't worried about his signature when he was dropping it off on the side of the road.Today, he did the same thing. Tracking shows ""recipient unavailable"". My daughter was here all Day and there was never FedEx at our property. At this point he's just flat out lying about attempting to deliver. He knows that by the time I finally get the food, it will be ruined. I don't know what to do. Since they're independent contractors, is there any recourse at all? He's obviously doing this to get back at me for complaining.

By now it has to be stinking up his truck being fresh food. I suppose he is going to wait until it is all rancid before he drops it off.

108,Chewy,chewy refund,1g0o487,N/A,2024-10-10,"The vast price difference between my pet pharmacy and Chewy I am still determining if this is common, but I just discovered that the vet prescribed Pimobendan tablets for my cat cost $189.83 for 45 tablets (2.5 mg) + $25 shipping. On Chewy, they have Pimobendan for dogs, so I didn't order. Then I found out they were the same thing from the vet pharmacy. The price difference floored me. On Chewy, I could order 100 tablets (2.5 mg) for $172.38 + free shipping. I quickly called the vet to see if I could ask for a refund, and they said no since it's already shipped.

So, I pay $4.21 per tablet at the Vet's office, while Chewy charges only $1.72 per tablet.

This is outrageous! Did any of you see similar patterns with your vet pharmacy? Is there anything I can do about it? Could I file a complaint to consumer protection? Does this count as exploitative pricing?

This medication has been used to sustain my cat's heart functioning since she was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Since she was diagnosed at the emergency last month, we've been giving her this medication every day, prescribed by the emergency vet. It has helped her so much. But I'm not going to lie: the cost of the medication is so expensive.

At least I learned my lesson. From now on, I will always check on Chewy.

Thanks for letting me vent.

Thank you all so much for your comments! I’ve learned a lot from your insights. Here’s a quick summary:

From the vet’s perspective, the price markup is often justified as necessary to keep the business running. I still need to look into this more. Our cat recently had a stay at the emergency hospital for heart failure treatment, and the costs of her previous dental procedures and lab tests for kidney disease have been quite high. While I understand the need to sustain a business, I’m not sure if a markup of over 50% is reasonable. When she was in the ICU, we didn’t have the luxury of time to compare prices with places like Chewy or other sources; we had to go with what the vet prescribed. We should hold them accountable for not exploiting patients in desperate situations.

For non-urgent medications, here are some recommended sources shared in the comments:

    •	Chewy (Use code RXSAVE20 for 20% off your first order)
    
    •	1800PetMeds.com
    
    •	Costco
    
    •	Walmart
    
    •	PetVM
    
    •	Humana (Still need to verify this one)
    
    •	Sometimes, your vet may suggest a human pharmacy for significant savings.

Thanks again for all your help!",post,54,0.86,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1g0o487/the_vast_price_difference_between_my_pet_pharmacy/,Chewy

To say I am disappointed in the new version of these after simply loving the old version is an understatement. The old version was a staple, bought and consumed weekly, a nice hearty, flavorful lunch. The old version had a pale green sauce, lots of chicken chunks and a nice, dense, chewy tortilla.

I could tell this wasn't going to be the same as it started microwaving- the offputting vinegar smell was my first clue. The burrito was the same shape and size, but all similarities end there. The sauce is brownish, not green, both liquidy AND weirdly gloppy in texture, and the flavor is wildly different.... and not good. There were four or five chicken pieces, which were tender, and some tiny shreds of chicken. The rest was gloppy, nasty sauce. 

I'm sorry I didn't photograph the inside; I was super hungry so I ate the thing, but never will again for sure. I rarely ask for a refund from Trader Joe's but I am going to this time.

I called chewy and spoke with Gilbert. I explained the situation to him that I meant to change the auto ship due to the Boe crossing. He was very caring and apologized. He refunded my money asked if I wanted to memorialize my profile of Boe. I said sure and thought that was the end of it.

Well today I got a knock on my door and a man was standing outside with a vase with flowers for me. Confused I took them inside and when I read the card it was from Gilbert and the chewy family. Sending me their love and condolences for the loss of Boe.

My cat's been having some dental pain so I switched her to just wet food (she saw the vet this morning) and she was loving the Weruva, especially Kitty Gone Wild. I ordered the 10-oz cans from Chewy. On Saturday night, she wouldn't eat her food but kept standing by her bowl. I checked it and there was a squishy larva of some sort in her food. The photo was after I stirred the food around to see if there were bones or something else she wanted me to remove.

I filled out their contact form on Saturday evening and still haven't heard anything as of Monday afternoon. I saved the can and the bug. I tried contacting them today but they conveniently close at 1:30 my time.

Chewy was amazing. They fully refunded my order and asked me to dispose of the case of food and donate the other Weruva items in my order.

120,Chewy,chewy refund,1kgozgq,N/A,2025-05-07,"Honest Kitchen points loss from expiration date change Hello.  This is a note for anyone buying Honest Kitchen dog food directly from their website [https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/) \- Check your points balance for expiration around 4/2025 after only one year due to a change in their terms, then request they be refunded because the terms didn't update until after 4/20/25.

For years, Honest Kitchen has run a reward system of earning points for purchases on their site, redeemable for discounts on future purchases.  Points always expired two years after being earned.  However, on 4/17/25, I discovered that some of my points had recently expired after only one year.  This also happened to my mother's and sister's accounts.  On 4/20/25, I captured PDFs of their rewards overview and terms pages showing that they should expire in two years.

Late in April, I contacted support about the premature expiration and they refunded the lost points.  At about that same time, Honest Kitchen updated their website with a slight redesign, some revised pages... and new rewards terms.  They state that points now expire within one year, they can change the terms at any time, they don't have to notify you, and you are responsible for keeping track of the rewards terms.  See the terms here - [https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/2024-rewards-terms-and-conditions](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/2024-rewards-terms-and-conditions)

I recommend that anyone with points check their rewards history at [https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/my-rewards](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/my-rewards)  It may show points expiring during early April, before the new terms.  It's tough to tell which points those were because you'll have spent the oldest points while earning more.  I copied the history into Excel and checked the running sum to confirm.  Do your best to check, but ultimately, unspent points earned over one year ago got expired.

If your points expired after one year before 4/20/25, contact support and ask for them to be refunded because their new one year expiration date was not public at that point.  When you get them back, spend them right away before any more expire.

Then buy Honest Kitchen at Chewy because their sales are vastly better than buying from Honest Kitchen directly.",post,0,0.33,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogFood/comments/1kgozgq/honest_kitchen_points_loss_from_expiration_date/,Chewy

In the meantime I saw a very recent Chewy review of the can food suddenly making their dog ill with very bad liver and pancreatic labs. Hoping this isn’t a future recall. 

Update: Here's some helpful info from a very busy day trying to figure out what's making my girl sick. 

Bought new canned z/d food: The cans I had were the 5.5oz cans from Chewy. I bought the 13oz cans from Petco last night to have something to feed her and saw the food inside looked so different from the 5.5oz cans: it was a different (more normal) color, no bubbly consistency, no weird dark specks of what could be chicken skin or something. No longer feeding her the old cans. 

Vet: did a stool sample, negative for Giardia and they didn't see anything under the microscope, but sending it off for further testing for more parasites. Also going back in for an exam and likely labs tomorrow. 

Called Hill's: they did a thorough review with me about the canned food I had, medical history, feeding habits, etc. I'm sending them more photos of the difference in how the food looked in the old cans from Chewy and the new cans from Petco. They also said they want to send me coupons. 

Called Chewy: Per advice from Hill's, called Chewy to alert them about the issue. They instructed I send back what I had left of the 24 pack and they will refund me for the entire pack.

I asked them to verify the address which they had the right address so I went back to double check my camera thinking ""ok maybe someone picked it up off my porch."" (I have never in the 8+ years of living here ever had someone take a package off my porch before but you know just to be sure.) I checked the exact time and date that they claimed it was delivered and nothing. I sent them a couple of clips showing that the package wasn't delivered there wasn't even any sign of the truck. They then claimed that the package was left at the outskirts of my home. I honestly don't believe this as I have never had a package left anywhere other than my porch. Also all my mail is delivered to my door because my mailbox is at my door. So it's unlikely they would place it somewhere else. I have only ever had this happen 1 other time over 5 years ago with an order from chewy which chewy immediately sent me another one. So I'm really not sure what to do at this point.

Amazon said that if I didn't hear back from them in 2 days they would give me an ""A to Z refund"" but I did here back from them they were just not helpful. Will Amazon still give me the refund? 

For some more insight. I order off Amazon all the time as I live an hr away from all big stores so it's better to order stuff online and have it delivered. At the same time I ordered this item I also ordered 15 other items. I received all other items. I have also placed 2 other orders since and have received those items as well.

It's been totally fine for years. The food is loose in consistency with chunks in gravy, chunks are pink and gravy is brown. Over the last several months we keep getting trays where every can that we open, the food is gray, looks like a patty, and is pulled away from the edges of the can. It has a rancid smell, so we keep having to report it and toss it. This has happened for 8 separate orders. 

Question is - does anyone see this happening that's not using chewy? Wanting to figure out if it's the source or the distributor that's causing problems. It's almost like it was sitting in the hot sun for weeks or something.

Since a lot of people have said this - we have reported it several times since earlier this spring. We got refunds each time but its getting annoying to have to dispose of the food and go through the process of documenting the pallet numbers/expiration dates etc. none of the cans were expired.",post,13,0.93,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1e9etxt/spoiled_food_is_it_chewy_or_purina/,Chewy
135,Chewy,chewy refund,1h70z2w,N/A,2024-12-04,"AM I WRONG FOR OPENING PREVIOUS TENANTS PACKAGES? For context, I’ve never met this person, but have dealt with plenty of shit involving this person. When I moved in, I had a man try to come into my house, and I found out later from a neighbor that it was apparently the previous tenants ex boyfriend. A few months after that, a sheriff was at my door asking if the previous tenant still lived in my apartment, and he proceeded to show me the warrant out for their arrest. Clearly, not a decent person. 

Well, the other day i received not 1, not 2, not 3, BUT 4 Chewy packages. Clearly it is some kind of pet food or kitty litter (big bags of something that are heavy), and I believe pet meds (one of the boxes says “simparica trio”). Now, I do have a dog, so I could possibly benefit by opening these boxes but I’m trying to be respectful if this person ends up coming by to pick up these items. However, they are huge, and they take up my front doorway (additional context — I live in a sort of walk up, so not wasting my energy lugging these upstairs when I’d rather just leave them at the door if this said person comes by). Plus, I’m just super curious to bust into them. If anything, I would end up donating this stuff to a shelter if I had no use for it, rather than just throw it away. I also see no point in calling FedEx because this was not my problem to begin with, and I feel as though that’s just an inconvenience for me and the least this person can do is simply get refunded or take the loss for not updating their shipping address.

139,Chewy,chewy refund,1em549p,N/A,2024-08-07,"Beware of Vetster: Hidden Fees, Limited Medications, and Price Gouging I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Vetster, an online vet service. The issues I encountered highlight some serious concerns regarding their anti-competition practices and price gouging, which I feel compelled to share with others considering their services.

**Hidden Fees and Deceptive Pricing**
I scheduled a vet visit that was advertised at $90. However, after various hidden fees were added, the final cost shot up to $120. This significant increase was not disclosed upfront, making the advertised price misleading.

**Limited Medication Options**
Another major issue is the limited range of medications that Vetster's vets can prescribe. This crucial information is not disclosed before the consultation, leading to further frustration when you realize that your pet's needs may not be fully met.

**Price Gouging with VetsterRX**
Vetster runs their own pharmacy service, VetsterRX, and the prices are exorbitant. They not only charge high prices for medications but also add a staggering $19 in service fees on top of shipping costs. This feels like blatant price gouging, especially considering the alternative options available.

**Refusal to Work with Chewy**
While Vetster offers to send prescriptions to outside pharmacies, they refuse to work with Chewy. This is particularly frustrating because medications through Chewy would be 70% cheaper. Their refusal to cooperate with a more affordable pharmacy seems like an intentional move to force customers to use VetsterRX, further highlighting their anti-competitive practices.

**Lack of Transparency and No Refund Policy**
None of these issues are advertised upfront. They only come to light after you’ve paid for the vet visit, which is incredibly deceptive. To make matters worse, when I reached out to Vetster to address these concerns, they refused to provide a refund despite their misleading pricing and service agreements.

In summary, Vetster's hidden fees, limited medication options, price gouging, and lack of transparency make them a service I cannot recommend. Their refusal to work with cheaper pharmacies and lack of a refund policy only adds to the frustration. I hope this review helps others avoid the same pitfalls I encountered",post,17,0.91,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1em549p/beware_of_vetster_hidden_fees_limited_medications/,Chewy
140,Chewy,chewy refund,1fxwmw7,N/A,2024-10-06,"What % of medication upcharge is normal at the vet? Hi all! 

I just took my cat to the vet for emergency services for the first time - the total cost was $280. I thought it was reasonable ($95 for the visit, $100 for two eye test strips, and another $80 for two eyedrops)

Specifically, they charged me $45.11 for one bottle of Ofloxacin Opthalmic Solution, and $36.75 for one Neo-Poly-Dex Opthalmic Suspension 

I paid on site because it was my first time taking my cat to the vet outside of a physical exam, and I felt very anxious about his health so I didn't ask a lot of questions about the price. 

But now that I've calmed down about my cat and I'm looking up the prices on chewy for these eyedrops, I can't believe how much cheaper they are?!!!

Chewy is selling the exact same Ofloxacin Opthalmic Solution for $10.99, and the Neo-Poly-Dex Opthalmic Suspension for $13.99!!! I would understand if they upcharged me slightly - maybe $20 and $25 respectively I would have been able to live with, but a 400% and 250% upcharge seems ridiculous and predatory. 

Is this normal?? Is there anything I can do? I've already opened up the eyedrop solutions and given it to my cat so I can't exactly go and ask for a return and refund. ",post,0,0.5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fxwmw7/what_of_medication_upcharge_is_normal_at_the_vet/,Chewy
141,Chewy,chewy refund,1h99rfh,N/A,2024-12-07,"The Pervasive Problem of Dented Pet Food *(tl;dr: Pet food stores are consistently sending damaged goods and fail to do anything to actually solve the problem. Something needs to be done, but I don't know what.)*

If you order canned food to be shipped to you, you know what I'm talking about. Every order, almost without fail, comes with at least a few dented cans—and in some orders, nearly all the cans are wrecked. It's especially bad when the box is being shipped from an individual Petsmart/Petco retail store, and especially especially bad when said box is being shipped via FedEx. Chewy isn't without blame either, but in my experience they at least put a little more effort into trying to get cans to you undamaged.

**They all offer replacements or refunds if you contact them, so what's the big deal?**

(1) My first concern would be for the consumers who receive these damaged cans and say, ""oh, they're just a \*little\* dented,"" and proceed to feed the food to their animals thinking nothing is really wrong. Sometimes that's true: depending on where the dents are, if they're relatively small they usually aren't a problem. But that ""depending on where the dents are"" is really important here. Cases when the can is unsafe to use, regardless of size/extent of damage:

* If the dents are on any seams (top, bottom, or side) or near the lid's seal
* If the dents have sharp edges or if there are two dents that meet at a point
* If the lid is bulging or pops when pressed
* If the can is heavily rusted (light surface rust is usually fine; rust *inside* the can is never fine)

If these companies are shipping out damaged cans to nearly every customer that orders them, there are probably a lot of people using unsafe products without realizing it. That's a big problem!

(2) My second concern is the additional burden placed on the consumer to remedy the problem when they receive defective product. Granted, the three companies named *do* make it fairly easy to get a refund or replacements, but there is still a burden there. It requires additional effort by the customer to make the contact and sometimes the companies require proof such as photos. If they opt for a refund, the customer then has to wait a few business days for their refund to process before they have access to those funds. If they want replacements, they then have to wait the additional time for replacements to be sent (and hope that the replacement shipment won't also come damaged), or they have to use their own time and resources to go to a retail location to exchange the damaged goods (IF that location has the same food in stock).

Considering the large scale of the problem, that's a pretty big collective burden being placed on their customers.

(3) Waste is an additional concern. Pet food isn't exactly a low-environmental-impact good, and there's a lot of product that ends up having to be thrown out.

**A couple objections I can hear you cooking up:**

""Ok, so why don't you just go to the store yourself instead of having it shipped?""— Chewy, for one, doesn't have any retail locations. Petsmart and Petco often have lower prices on their websites, which they *will* price match in their stores, but they usually also have additional discounts or offer cash back through Rakuten that can make it much cheaper to purchase items online. There's no option to pick up items in store if the store doesn't already have that item currently in stock. I usually save a lot of money having food shipped to me, even if I'd rather go to the store myself. Further, there are customers that aren't close to any retail locations whose only option is to have the items shipped.

""The problem is with the shipper, not the retailer!""— That is in part true. Especially if the shipper is FedEx. I'm not just arbitrarily picking on FedEx; in my anecdotal experience, at least 50% of the packages I have delivered to me by FedEx (pet food or otherwise) arrive *significantly* damaged (boxes smashed, crushed, partially open, etc.). So part of the problem is with how the shipping companies handle the items in their care. But the thing is, these pet retailers *know* that this is a problem. It then becomes their responsibility to either (a) package their items better to prevent damage, or (b) use a different shipping company that can actually deliver packages without destroying them. They're failing at this responsibility.

**So, what's my point here?** 

My point is that is a big, very real problem that these companies shouldn't just keep getting away with. (As a side note, how do they even afford to keep doing this? Are enough people just not seeking refunds/replacements?) If they can't ship these cans safely, they shouldn't ship them. They should stop incentivizing online vs. in-store purchases, and they should figure out packaging adequately designed to ship them safely.

I don't know how to solve the problem, and beyond writing this too-long post, I personally don't have the energy or resources to do it. Is there some governmental body that consumers can report to? Is there a journalist somewhere that could investigate the scope of the issue? Is this grounds for a class-action lawsuit? I genuinely don't know.",post,4,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1h99rfh/the_pervasive_problem_of_dented_pet_food/,Chewy

i currently have the niteangel 47 inch vista cage with the 12 inch wheel from them as well. most of the hideouts/chambers are from niteangel, except the two ceramic ones, which are from bucastate. he has around 10 inches of bedding and i recently took out the grapevine branch bc when i had it in the enclosure, he would just walk around it so im trying to search for a new branch he could go on. cork logs aren't easily available in my area, so id have to wait to get it from chewy or petco (assuming i can find things that id need that would meet the $35 minimum for free shipping LOL). the pet stores around my area dont really have the cork logs or anything cork/grapevine branch related, so it's a bit hard for me to just buy them. he also has different sprays but he has no interest in them despite me leaving them around the cage. i have rice, wheat, oat, red sorghum (I dont think im spelling it right), and millets (the smaller ones and the clustered ones). so idk what im missing :c

i have a 4 month old syrian who keeps trying to escape because he found out recently that the lid is the way to get out of the cage, as he has done it once before when he climbed on top of the cactus and climbed to the top of the cage and almost got out. i got there in time luckily to see him doing that and moved the castle to the back of the cage. my question is how to stop him from wanting to escape because he does this every now and then, but this week, he's been doing it a lot more. 

i have lotus pods coming in (for hiding treats/seeds/forage). i also have different treats and chews/forage (flowers/herbs) coming in as well, but not until monday. i want to make sure he's not unhappy, but it just doesn't seem like he is happy because he keeps wanting to escape. he doesn't seem stressed, but i could be misreading the situation, and he may be stressed. i guess my question is, does anyone have any advice on what i can do to provide better enrichment for him. 

note: he does have playpen time, and he usually doesn't show that he wants to escape, but today is the day he chose he wants to start his plan to escape and climbs everything he sees in sight. i want to make him feel at home bc i got him like 2 weeks ago, but i don't want to rush him into feeling like things are going to be ok when he doesn't feel the way i do.

So I'll be putting down a list of vegan restaurants (plus super vegan friendly places) I ate at during my trip. 

I found information via Happy Cow, Google map lists (I found multiple, some via this sub), and instagram accounts, and sometimes a google maps search finds the lesser known places. https://isitveganjapan.com/ is useful too. 

The ordering per city reflects how much I liked the place, but city order is my reverse travel order. I put Tokyo first because that's where my top 3 are. I was with family so we ordered different things and share. My preference is to support fully Vegetarian/Vegan places over places that are vegan-friendly, no matter how big their vegan menu is.

Super long post incoming. Keep in mind these are my personal experiences, YMMV, and I have missed many great places.

**Tokyo**

[**Loving Hut Tokyo Nishi-Nippori**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/puoTcc2K287MbRYk8)

* My Number 1 meal(s) in Japan, even though it's a long trek out from the nearest JR/Metro line, only open at some specific times of the week, it's well worth the planning and the trip!
* All the rice sets are GREAT. They were so good the two of us ate in and got 2 sets and went back to the counter and ordered another 2 bento as well.
* Soy and lotus root 'eel' especially had the right amount of Chinese peppercorn on it that adds that extra dimension of flavor. I love it when Chinese peppercorns is there by itself (without super hot chilli).
* Karaage had perfect texture. It is a rather more textured-soy texture which I personally love, but may not be what you expect if you were expecting Izakaya Masaka karaage.
* Hamburger was actually Japanese style? She made it out of some kind of loose soy something, was great, served with some kind of tomato sauce (not ketchup).
* Mapo tofu was surprisingly good and left me wanting more Japanese style mapo tofu.
* In each rice set, there was a great variety of really great side dishes, there was salad, a tiny curry korokke, some pickles (fresh cucumber and sesame daikon, neither is too salty) and a small amount of dessert (coconut cream sweet potatoes in ours). The soup has a good amount of veggies, not mostly liquid like a lot of other miso soups we've had this trip.
* I also ordered the mugwort cake. The sweetness level is very light to highlight the mugwort taste. Make sure you eat in so it's warmed up with fresh tofu cream.
* The sushi needs to be pre-ordered, which is a shame, but turns out I might have loved the hot foods more than the sushi.
* Did I mention it's very reasonably priced for Tokyo? If you order the rice sets togo (same amount of food as dine in minus soup), the prices becomes outright amazing.
* Cash only. Maybe IC card accepted but I didn't ask for that.
* Check their Instagram account for opening state and events etc.
* **Recommend:** Everything, but ""Eel"" and Mapo tofu in particular.

**T's Tantan Ramen**

* Not putting a google maps link for this one since it has so many branches including the airports! But that's for a VERY good reason, their ramen is simply AMAZING! My Number 2 in Japan, almost tied for Number 1.
* Golden Sesame TanTan is the promoted ramen that's plastered all over the place for a good reason. It really is GREAT. I accidentally ordered Konjac noodles instead of large portion noodles, but it fits amazingly well in this ramen broth.
* The autumn seasonal soy sauce(?) ramen was also amazing. In this bowl I managed to order the large portion of wheat noodles I initially wanted, and it's like DOUBLE the amount of noodles haha, we ended up scooping the extra noodles into the Sesame tantan broth and it's also great.
* Their wheat noodle is what I envisioned good Japanese ramen to be. Maybe it's not handmade (they are a chain after all) but it really hits my spot.
* Both broths are very drinkable.
* Did I mention their prices are amazing too?
* Their cup ramen is my top cup noodle now! Comes with veggies that somehow become super fresh after rehydration. Had them hot on Zipair. If your Zipair flight offers them, go for it! It costed us 500 yen per cup which was fine with us since they bring it to you with hot water already in it. But you should also buy some from convenience stores if you see any! (They cost more from the restaurant for some reason)
* **Recommend:** Golden Sesame Tantan, konjac noodle (at least once), cup ramen (from supermarket or conbini).

[**VEGAN GYOZA YU**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fgtnVgEgTyQSjz4R8)

* A bit of a walk from JR/metro stations, but also worth it. My Number 3 favorite in Japan
* They serve one thing only and does it VERY WELL. Multi-colored, super instagrammable dumplings, hand made from filling to wrapper.
* The wrapper is LEGIT. Hand made, fresh, no fillers or preservatives. I know because I make my own dumpling wrappers from scratch too.
* Each colored dumpling has its own flavor, we only ordered steamed, since we both wanted steamed more than pan-fried, and gyoza isn't really sharable.
* The best one is Shiitake. They gave each set 2 of Shiitake because one of their flavors (some kind of fresh pickled cabbage?) was seasonal only... But at least there was 2 of the best flavor!
* Each gyoza has a rather different flavor, all of them good, some of them GREAT.
* The reason this place is only number 3 in my books is because some flavors are a tad salty, had to drink a lot of water. I mentioned this to the server (who spoke English) but she said that some people still wanted soy sauce with their dumplings...???
* As a side note, I consider dumplings that requires soy sauce/some kind of salty sauce WEAK since that means their fillings does not have enough flavor. Not a problem in this gyoza place!
* **Recommend:** They only have 1 set meal, I love the steamed version, can't say anything about pan-fried but it looks good without being too oily.

[KOMEDA is □ Higashi Ginza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DF9pB8arVcPtoPoT6)

* One of Japan's favorite chain kissaten but the only vegan branch in the entire nation (for now, hopefully)
* Open super early for breakfast, has a good value breakfast deal. But it's only good if you like fluffy puffy Japanese bread.
* I liked their sandwiches a lot more! Great variety too.
* A non-vegan Japanese friend ordered a burger (they have burgers but with Japanese style sauces), and said it tasted so good he won't have guessed it's vegan!
* We should have eaten here a lot more often...
* **Recommend:** Sandwiches! And maybe burger.

[hal okada vegan patisserie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHXFyXadzcigudvs5)

* Not near any sightseeing spots I wanted to go to, but I've also been following their instagram for ages so I just had to go.
* Fresh, packed super well, survived me careless carrying it around through shopping and trains. I got a cheesecake that was gone far too fast for my own good.
* **Recommend:** Yes. (whatever they have on day of your visit)

[Injoy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1MwXWkrfEgURzqv26)

* Taiwanese vegan place really near Asakusa metro. But food isn't exactly Taiwanese.
* Lunch sets gets bundled with expensive Taiwan herbal tea that tastes strongly of ginseng. I'm not a fan. Don't know about dinner time.
* Best item is bibimbap surprisingly, the stone pot is actually hot so you get crispy rice at the bottom. Full of tasty veggies.
* **Recommend:** Bibimbap! Dandan noodle is fine too, but I'd recommend T's for that.

[Hatoya’s Vegan Fruit Sandwiches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HGdL5JXxfKvHQ97K9)

* Conveniently located near Sensoji, but inconveniently only open at 11am which is when all the crowd is there too.
* It's exactly what it looks like, soy cream filled sandwiches with fruits in them.
* I got a strawberry one. The hidden ""corner"" of the triangle shaped sandwich bread, did, in fact, contain more whole strawberry. Tasty.
* Soy cream tastes very fresh. But in the end, it tastes like exactly what is said on the tin, white Japanese bread, fruit, sweet cream. Not something I actively crave or dream about.
* There are 2 vegan fruit sandwich places in Tokyo, but I chose to have it here since it's near Sensoji. (The other one is fruit and season, that place seems to have more fruit variety but is higher priced and needs a drink order if you want to dine-in.)
* **Recommend:** I think it's seasonal fruits, but strawberry should always be on the options (probably using frozen fruit).

[SUNDAY VEGAN](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9fPjrShLZMvsbhbE6)

* The reason to walk between Ghibli museum and Kichijoji Station.
* They only have sweet donuts and maybe tea/coffee, but one of the best sweet donut I've ever had. (and I've had them aplenty all across California)
* Got the staff recommended soy cream filled donut and chocolate erm, square shaped donut? Don't remember the name. But both are light and fluffy to perfection
* JUST the right level of sweetness.
* **Recommend:** Soy cream filled donut, but best ask the friendly shop staff who speaks basic English.

[AIN SOPH. Soar IKEBUKURO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q4cD5LdeaVfgXqfZ7)

* I avoided Ain Sophs around Tokyo/Kyoto since the menu looks pretty Western without the localization changes in sauces like Komeda Is \_ but they are in good locations.
* Took a brief snack here between shopping, so only got a small salad and single side of soy cutlet.
* The one meal item I wanted to try from them (mushroom hayashi rice) was OOS that day...
* Soy cutlet tastes fine, has with a crispy batter coat. White sauce significantly better than black.
* Small salad comes with good dressing and a few small bits of avocado. Surprisingly tasty.
* Don't miss their dessert menu! I did :(
* **Recommend:** Salad. Seriously. I'd have also ordered the Creme Brulee too but forgot about the dessert menu.

Tea shop inside Teamlab Borderless

* Everything is vegan but a bit overpriced, but you are paying for experience of having flowers in your tea and a flowering tree grow out of your icecream bowl.
* **Recommend:** Rice milk tea + ice cream.

[8balish](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tpj6X2rvuVJCREqY8)

* Conveniently right across teamlabs Borderless, decent vegan food.
* Menu looks a lot like what I'd find in the US instead of in Japan.
* The bagel with cream cheese was chewy and tough. Don't bother.
* The assorted tapas vegetables of the day with rice was decent.
* **Recommend:** Tapas set of the day, dessert.

Honorable mention:  [Tofu maker in Asakusa 栃木家商店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h51CU1QdJSSuR1ZE9)

* Makes and sell fresh tofu products, we found them by accident by smelling the scent of freshly made tofu when walking a side street.
* Not everything is vegetarian, shop staff understands vegetarian but not much English, so knowing basic Japanese vocab about vegan food / Google translate helps.
* Sells a soy sauce +wasabi + chopsticks set for 50yen so you can eat the fresh soy products you just purchased.
* Their star product Asakusa Yuba is almost like drinking soy milk, I still like regular yuba more, but worth a try.
* The fried tofu patty-like thing turned out rather bland by itself, and with soy sauce it's still mediocre.
* **Recommend:** Abura-age (fried tofu sheet, lasts long without fridge). Yuba (only if you can eat it in a couple of hours, goes bad FAST).

[Izakaya Masaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n46fBjNNvBsmNKnv7)

* The Shibuya mall it's in has a great Nintendo, Capcom, and other game/animanga stores on its top floor.
* The only time we had to wait for seats in Japan. People who arrived 10 minutes after us were refused entry, we got on the waiting list so we were ok.
* When we went in, a lot of items were sold out. No mapo tofu so we made do with karaage, which was was good tasting but not enough crispiness. This is a ""softer"" kind of mock meat, probably mimics chicken better? I've been vegan for too long to be able to tell.
* The crispy fried Maitake mushroom was more crispy but does not come with sauce and the batter tastes unsalted.
* Rice was left in steaming for WAY too long and has became mushy. Worst rice we had in Japan. Still worth it since you need rice for all the salty stuff, get the rice set.
* Gyoza was fine. Did not get burnt. The people next to us was served spring rolls that was charred.
* Mizuna salad was too salty+spicy and comes way before the rice, dressing and salt well not mixed well.
* Maybe this is an authentic izakaya experience? But prices aren't low for what you get.
* **Recommend:** Karaage + rice set (maybe mapo tofu is better that's why it sold out). But you aren't missing out if you don't get to enter.

[Taiyaki Hiiragi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B8GWX5uMfVRDY3PE8)

* Vegan taiyaki (red bean filling). No queues.
* Filling is a tad too sweet, the fish shaped shell is crispy but a bit too thin. I preferred the Gozasoro pastries (later in this post).
* Only eat one if you have to have a vegan taiyaki near a metro station. I believe there is one other place with naturally vegan taiyaki called Nezu Taiyaki but that's a bit out of the way of metro, and has queues.

[Komaki Shokudo Kamakura Fushikian](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dHipu5eUFy7qLmqA6)

* Only (?) full vegan place in Akibahara, but you should seriously just take the JR to another station with T's Tantan instead, especially if it's dinner time. Or maybe I was ripped off with tourist menu?
* I was charged 2200 yen for a tiny amount of udon, tiny amount of super tough green veggies, small bits of mushroom that doesn't even add up to a single mushroom, one piece of too-sweet aburaage, and soup that was too salty to drink. There's a tiny amount of rice to supposedly wash down that soup, but it's so tiny. Oh and some very thinly sliced. I'd be ok with it if I was only charged half of this, but 2200 is ridiculous.
* Not recommended, or just don't get their kitsune udon, it's a total ripoff. (EDIT: changed wording of this section to something less strong after reading horror stories from carnivore meals in Japan)

***Places I wanted to go but had to skip because of scheduling/timing etc:***

[Veganic Monkey Magic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kq9TTUfsEiQSPFwf7) (reservation only! but their mostly dinner-only schedule clashed with our trip plans, so we had to pass on this. There's an Airbnb upstairs Oyado Matsumura that I almost booked, but I decided on a proper hotel in the end.)

[Marugoto Vegan Dining Asakusa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g5FTJS5ebv7TubDKA) (was a hard decision between this and Injoy)

[Bon 梵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s3zf2S2Ky59kyVLF9) (drooled over this on instagram, but looked expensive and I wasn't hyped enough to make the out-of-the-way trip, and I was disillusioned with ""fine-dining"" from the Shigetsu experience, more on that in Kyoto section.)

[the vegan marshmallooow ザ ヴィーガン マシュマロ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JiGXDVsVN8bGCbCY6) (dessert shop in Ginza)

[2foods](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5EU4YPfTEU4opsaB7) (they seem to be donut+burger focused but also have omurice and some other things)

[Vegan Bistro Jangara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PF27yc21DpKiq7Jx7) (there's nothing I wanted to visit in Harajuku except this place, and I'm not hyped enough to make this extra stop)

[Guruatsu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zbahqa29EgZse2Ax8) (near Ueno station, I ended up skipping Ueno park+museum because I was tired from Kyoto walking...)

[Sarasya Shinsen Chaen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MPskkSZdQAXNSHaU7) (right in the middle between Mitaka station and Ghibli Museum, but they only JUST re-opened with irregular opening hours and limited stock. I didn't want to go to Ghibli hungry in case they run out of food or something when we reach there.)

**Kyoto**  
Interestingly, I did not love the food in Kyoto as much I expected. Maybe because quite a few of the places I wanted to go to were not open that day unannounced (Izakaya nijiya), or reservation recommended (and we were too tired to go and TRY, hindsight we should have tried), or they closed a few months ago... Don't rely on Happy Cow, Google Map search the word ""vegan"" gives more immediate vicinity results.

[Ramen Towzen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PL8insVTnhF7hoef8)

* Hard to get to, the wait for the bus to get there was LONG (bus timetables goes completely out of the window with Kyoto night traffic). Take a taxi. It'll make your meal a lot more enjoyable.
* The ramen itself has alright texture, its alkaline-ness was a bit more noticable than other places. Musashi broth was pretty good, but not as great as I hoped  (maybe I just hyped myself up too much from all the waiting). Still my favorite meal in Kyoto.
* Musashi ramen comes with a tiny piece of yuba on top, it left me wanting the yuba sashimi, but the set comes with potato salad+eggplant sushi+soy pudding dessert and left me really full...
* The highlight was the pressed eggplant sushi! I love my eggplant grilled.
* I like T's in Tokyo better for Dandan noodles.
* **Recommend:** Musashi ramen set (with eggplant sushi and salad). Tried both and this is the better one.

[silver backs cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HX82DLHRkxULM6Rr5)

* The logo looks exactly like the owner!
* Pretty tasty food, but menu had a lot of non-Japanese-ish foods like Pho and nachos? Nope, we were tourist to Kyoto and wanted only Japanese-ish foods! (like, Japanese style curry is ok, but I'm not ordering Thai green curry in Kyoto if I can help it). Nevertheless, it probably is a good thing for Japanese people to eat vegan food from all over the world.
* Ended up with the Japanese lunch set and grilled ""meat"" set.
* **Recommend:** grilled ""meat"" set, the wasabi dressing salad it comes with pairs very well with the mock meat.

[Vegetarian Cafe Ren Horikawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZFEVT9T4sohtfha38)

* A few bus stops north of Nijo castle, but they should have other chains as well. Turns out they speak Chinese better than their English. Taiwanese owner I think?
* Very varied menu, should have ordered more togo in hindsight.
* **Recommend:** Soy milk hotpot set. Comes with gyoza, which tastes like store bought but it's also one of my favorite brand of store bought gyozas.

[TORIBA COFFEE KYOTO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RPuL7hKNaSSViSrR8)

* ""walking"" distance from Meiji Jingu
* Their food items seem to be all vegan but their lattes seem to be milk by default? We aren't coffee people, can't tell how good is the coffee.
* Sandwiches are tasty but portions are rather small.
* On their ""new item"" menu is a ""fish"" sandwich. It's a perfectly fried some kind of patty (with a tiny bit of veggies in it?). I love my crispy edges in fried foods.
* Also advertised an ""egg"" sandwich, staff (owner?) said it's made with pumpkins. I suspected it's the same recipe as the MERCY cafe one (more on that below) and skipped it.
* **Recommend:** ""Fish"" sandwich, ""katsu"" sandwich.

[Tenryuji Temple Shigetsu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R9hrGUeSVLGWt8E87)

* Most expensive, but far from my favorite place in Kyoto. I pre-ordered the Moon meal (6500yen) and it was a LOT of food.
* Fun dining experience, food is interesting but not the most tasty. The dishes are seasonal, so photos you see of that awesome grilled eggplant? Nope, not there if you go in the wrong season.
* The highlight of the meal was the yuba skin which I think comes with every other set too. The suspected Moon set extra dish was some kind of couscous and dango soup dish and the only thing to note is how filling it is.
* Way too much rice cake in our set. Maybe we just went in the wrong time? What's up with all the rice cakes?
* Tofu looking thing is some kind of nut tofu cake (other reviews say it's sesame but I also taste peanuts). Interesting texture, but one experience is enough.
* If you forgot your reservation, there's another Yudofu place nearby that's fully vegetarian! Seizan Sodo.
* **Recommend:** reserve your place ahead of time, but stick to the 3800 yen set.

[MERCY Vegan Factory KYOTO STATION](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kVePjvapXPjGgW877)

* I regretfully had only time to grab some togo items, their menu looks amazing
* Great egg salad sandwich!
* However their crossiants/breads are super gluten-y (maybe their dough overdeveloped on that day?), one of the toughest soft bread I've had. Shame, the flavoring was great.
* **Recommend:** egg salad sandwich (but I should have went back and ordered something as dine in)

[CAFE TEA TERRACE (VEGAN, GLUTEN-FREE, VEGETARIAN)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e81KaG4EPte2jhyv5)

* Ramen soup was good, comes with decent amount of veggies, but noodle itself was millet based and has a pretty rough texture. I guess it's because they needed a gluten free food item? Celiac/gluten allergic people would appreciate this better than we did.
* Egg salad sandwich filling tasted JUST like the one from MERCY, but is in a thick toast pocket instead of fluffy plain bread, and I enjoyed this one more. I encountered the same claim of ""vegan pumpkin based egg salad"" sandwich in Toriba coffee too, so now I'm suspecting they are all from one single supplier (MERCY?).
* Dango set is too expensive for what it is, so they tried to make up for it by putting gold in the sesame sauce... the result is acceptable but not worth it.
* **Recommend:** egg salad sandwich (if you haven't had the one from MERCY or any other places in Kyoto.)

Honorable mention:

[Gyomu Super Sanjo-kawaramachi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ff4AKgXsRxgowiPj8)

* Small supermarket in the middle of one of the busiest areas in Kyoto, but with SUPER CHEAP PRICES. It's where restaurants go and get their supplies.
* Never pay for edamame in a restaurant because you can get them for super cheap in here!
* They have decently priced fresh tofu, veggies, microwave rice, mochi... Enough for a half decent dinner/breakfast if you have access to a microwave.
* Not a lot of vegan instant food selection (didn't check their curry sauce section), so you may need to get some sauce. We opted for rubbing some salt from the pre-salted edamame instead...
* **Highly recommended if you want to save some money**

There was also a small stall selling tofu manju section in the back of Okutan Kiyomizu (which isn't vegan because of dashi, no idea how friendly they actually are). The tofu manju is vegan (the girl took out an ingredients card to check too). But it's skin is really sweet while the filling is a savory and NOT worth it.

***Places I wanted to go but had to skip:***

[Gion Soy Milk Ramen Uno Yokiko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3abhJSLjAFA7oVdQA) I wanted to go, but got tired from walking sooo much that day.

[VEGAN IZAKAYA 虹屋 nijiya VEGAN FARM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6TUrXujZS3cR5gFk7) was closed without notice on the day I was there.

[Seizan Sodo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nbt3eTfngjsvoTBH7) vegetarian Yudofu place really near Arashiyama station, I was recommended this if Shigetsu didn't have open spots for lunch. So don't fret if you forget to do reservations!

[Daitokuji Ikkyu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HKStwDXdteBuYLRq6) right next to Daitoku-ji Temple (Ikkyu temple). I didn't check if it's possible to walk in though... I might have been disappointed without a reservation.

[Vegan Ramen UZU Kyoto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aZPa5fZt4rszgWme7) when I wanted to eat there I realized it's their closed days, which was almost all our days in Kyoto...

[waco crepes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oPsRxXgf3SZ7qo8v9) crepe shop with good vegan options, I could never make it there when they are open, even though our hotel is really near the place.

**Himeji**

Because we rode the Hello Kitty Shinkansen here from Hiroshima which arrives at an odd time, we ended up eating lunch at almost 4pm after we finished exploring Himeji Castle and Koko-en. Koko-en, despite good reviews from this sub, is not worth it if it's not height of whatever season you are there, for us it's momiji season but there was hardly any red.

[il riccio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2UEQ2zDx4SFnFf91A)

* The only vegan place that's in between Himeji Castle and train station, follow Google Maps, past the ramen shop right next to it with big signs advertising their VEGAN NOODLE, ignoring their attempt to scam vegan tourists.
* The actual place is half-shop half restaurant. There was a few rice sets we could order. The lunch set of the day was delicious, as was the mushroom-and-gluten rice set. Some dishes are light on salt/soy sauce but you can also taste the flavor of ingredients.
* **Recommend:** lunch set of the day, cookies/bakery items
* There was a few vegan packet ramen in the shop (owner will very helpfully tell you the TRUE vegan ones without hidden dashi), but they were a hit-and-miss, since they aren't in cups so you need to get a microwave container to cook them as a tourist, and contains no freeze-dry veggies. Just noodle and soup.

**Miyajima**

[Rokaku Tea House (Hexagon Cafe)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RNHjo5MzYYFDzD4a7)

* Right next to the entrance after entering Daishoin temple, look for the cafe sign. Really cute temple!
* I think they always have one rotating food item that's vegan. When we went, it's a very nicely plated curry rice, and there was a vegan soymilk pudding as well!
* Did not taste that much like Japanese curry (it tasted more Indian, but with very little heat) and had nuts in it. Great hot meal in a nice place.

Everything on Miyajima closes around 5pm, and we were tired from walking so did not check if any dinner places have decent vegan options, we just went back to our hotel and ate the brown rice sushi we packed from Osaka. There was a Lawson and Starbucks open, but I didn't go in to check for vegan options.

Hiroshima honorable mention:

[Gozasoro 御座候](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ev1CBAhzKoSATNQv7) (chain bakery of one single kind of Japanese sweet)

* Apparently it's a chain! just google map search this name and see if you have a store near your travel destinations. Or traverse their official shop listing website in Japanese. I've seen locations in train stations aplenty in Kansai, apparently it's in Tokyo as well!
* The basic sweet itself is really cheap and naturally vegan, but this location in particular turns out to also sells pork meat buns as a side hustle. But that's in the steamer and the sweets are from the moulded pans. This just happen to be the location I visited, but because of the pork bun thing I'd probably visit another of their chain locations.
* The sweet itself is pretty good! They'll box it up really nicely for you so it remains warm after a few hours, not overly sweet and we could have it without tea. Both kinds of bean pastes tastes pretty freshly made, not packaged.
* **Recommend:** Get both flavors! They are real cheap.

**Osaka**

[Brown Rice Sushi TEC 玄米のおすしテック ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VqL5CJLdSC2szSb36)

* Opens really early (7:30am). They have a great breakfast deal (before 8am)
* Walking distance from Shin Osaka station
* Only a small table for eating in, pack a lot of things if you the daytrip location you are visiting is inconvenient for vegan food. (for us, it's Miyajima at dinnertime)
* Fresh ingredients, especially the salad leaves they use, and somehow they stay fresh.
* **Recommend:** Chirashi sushi, and anything with their Koji Tofu and Tempeh.

[OKO Takoyaki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MRPS36j2RfMHkyBY6)

* I've seen people confuse this place and their OKO Okonomiyaki location. The Okonomiyaki location is not fully vegan, just vegan friendly. This place is fully vegan.
* That said, I found the takoyaki a bit too soft and starchy. Probably because it's gluten free, so they had to use just starch/starchy vegetable to bind the okara. And it's rather oily.
* Veggies on kushikatsu are tiny. Is it supposed to be tiny?
* Cost wise, extremely good deal since it comes as a set with salad and soup, I liked the salad and kushikatsu better than the takoyaki.
* Given the choice to choose again, I might have gone to Pivot cafe which has takoyaki and other menu items too, or Shinsekai Paprika Shokudo but they are closed on the day we were in Osaka.

***Places I wanted to go but had to skip:***

[Shojin Sushi Minamo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y49SCQNL2ZM7iZoy8)  new vegan sushi place! but also closed on the days I was in Osaka.

[Aju](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WkcYa6bdLnjw6L2A) I read this place has only 4 seats... wasn't feeling adventurous to go somewhere that needed a plan B on my first jetlagged night in Japan

[Pivot BASE Cafe & Bar ＠Dotonbori](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nSgZzYU1NCPV3wG9A) their instagram account looks very tourist-targeted which may not be a bad thing, but I chose to try OKO instead since they are more ""famous"".

i currently have the niteangel 47 inch vista cage with the 12 inch wheel from them as well. most of the hideouts/chambers are from niteangel, except the two ceramic ones, which are from bucastate. he has around 10 inches of bedding and i recently took out the grapevine branch bc when i had it in the enclosure, he would just walk around it so im trying to search for a new branch he could go on. cork logs aren't easily available in my area, so id have to wait to get it from chewy or petco (assuming i can find things that id need that would meet the $35 minimum for free shipping LOL). the pet stores around my area dont really have the cork logs or anything cork/grapevine branch related, so it's a bit hard for me to just buy them. he also has different sprays but he has no interest in them despite me leaving them around the cage. i have rice, wheat, oat, red sorghum (I dont think im spelling it right), and millets (the smaller ones and the clustered ones). so idk what im missing :c

i have a 4 month old syrian who keeps trying to escape because he found out recently that the lid is the way to get out of the cage, as he has done it once before when he climbed on top of the cactus and climbed to the top of the cage and almost got out. i got there in time luckily to see him doing that and moved the castle to the back of the cage. my question is how to stop him from wanting to escape because he does this every now and then, but this week, he's been doing it a lot more.

i have lotus pods coming in (for hiding treats/seeds/forage). i also have different treats and chews/forage (flowers/herbs) coming in as well, but not until monday. i want to make sure he's not unhappy, but it just doesn't seem like he is happy because he keeps wanting to escape. he doesn't seem stressed, but i could be misreading the situation, and he may be stressed. i guess my question is, does anyone have any advice on what i can do to provide better enrichment for him.

note: he does have playpen time, and he usually doesn't show that he wants to escape, but today is the day he chose he wants to start his plan to escape and climbs everything he sees in sight. i want to make him feel at home bc i got him like 2 weeks ago, but i don't want to rush him into feeling like things are going to be ok when he doesn't feel the way i do.

207,Chewy,chewy autoship,1j50hej,N/A,2025-03-06,"Does anyone else use Simparica Trio for heartworm prevention? Has anyone else noticed that Simparica Trio has gone way up? I decided to do some math to see if the price difference between the smallest and largest doses actually makes sense—and what I found is pretty messed up. My boy is 135lbs and my vet insists he also gets the additional small pill since he's over the limit. 

Here’s the Breakdown Based on Total Milligrams per Chew (prices from Chewy WITH discount:

1. Smallest Dose (2.8–5.5 lbs):

Total mg per chew: 2.572 mg

Price per year (12 doses, autoship): $330.87

Cost per mg: $10.73 per mg


2. Largest Dose (88.1–132 lbs):

Total mg per chew: 373.44 mg

Price per year (12 doses, autoship): $384.22

Cost per mg: $0.086 per mg

........

Key Finding: WTF?!

The smallest dose is over 120 times more expensive per mg than the largest dose.

Even though the largest dose has 145 times more active ingredients, it only costs $53.35 more per year than the smallest dose.

This feels like a blatant rip-off for giant breed owners like me who are stuck paying way more for essentially the same meds.

Has Anyone Else Noticed This?

Is there any justification for this kind of price disparity, or are we just getting screwed by Zoetis?

Warning: Simparica is not the same.  

Almost every US pharmacy, petmed online, chewy, petco etc. charged $188.  There were some discounts on first orders or autoship.  I was looking for ongoing price, so discounts on the first order weren't of interest.

  
Costco had it for about $120/150 depending if you were a member.

PetVnm offered it for $153.

I did not check on shipping, sales tax, or if you needed a script.  In WA state, shipping/tax could add another $26 to the order.

I then went to Canadian pet med places.  Most prices were under $100.

  
I ended up buying it from Canadapetcare.com.  It was 97.53.  I found a coupon online for 20% off the order.  They automatically select $6.95 for tracked shipping, but I chose free.  No script required.  I paid $78 instead of $200.

A month after Chewy wasn’t able to fulfill our last autoship, they were able to fulfill this months and I was so relieved. But now his body is having to get back used to the PR, which he’d been on for 3 years after a miserable time finding food he wasn’t allergic to. 

Probiotics are not helping and that seems to be all that vets have to offer me since this isn’t from a bacterial infection that can just be fixed by antibiotics. I know personally how miserable it is to constantly be in stomach pain and having diarrhea and bloating because it took till I was 13 to finally learn I was lactose intolerant. It’s killing me not being able to help my baby boy. He’s such a trooper but he’s miserable and I’m exhausted from him him waking me up multiple times every night constantly hungry from not absorbing his food.

There's a big white one and a darker one that visit, and a week or so ago there were lots of babies in the yard as well. I know they need specific diets and such, I put kitty food and sardines out for the adults but I wanted to find something healthier when I saw the babies because tiny tummies can be more sensitive and pretty much all there is for them around here is people's trash. I've had to pull a few out of my trash can because they couldn't get out. Anyway, I buy all my pet foods from chewy because I have a pretty big variety of critters. And out off curiosity I put opossum food in the search bar. They actually have an opossum diet on there! It has dry bugs, dry fruits, and pellets, from what I can tell with the naked eye. It's a little expensive for the amount you get, but since it's baby season I think it's worth it just to make sure the babies get at least somewhat of a balanced diet. Don't have any pics of my locals yet, as I'm usually not thinking about snapping a pic lol I'm just always so excited to see them. They're my favorite things.

213,Chewy,chewy autoship,1jz4rf2,N/A,2025-04-14,"FIXED! [hopefully] LR4 Stopping Every Cycle We have two LR4s.  One is two years old.  One is two months old.  Having 3 cats, one wasn't quite enough.  We added the litter hopper to the older one about a month or so before we bought the new one (which also has the hopper).

Shortly after adding the hopper, the older LR4 would stop every cycle.  Every. Single. Cycle.  I would get the notification in the app that the scale had been active for 30+ minutes.  Then I'd reset it from the app and it would resume the cycle.

I tried every troubleshooting tip I could find on the website, on reddit, on YouTube, you name it.  Nothing worked.  Then, one day it started working again out of the blue.  I noticed that the litter was way low, about an inch and a half below the ""optimal"" line.  I wasn't paying attention and let the hopper empty completely, so every time it cycled the level was getting lower.

When I filled the hopper and added litter to the globe, it paused again its first cycle.  This led me to believe that it was a weight sensor issue.  When it was lighter ie less litter, it ran fine, but when it was full it would cause a fault.  While I was talking to support, she asked me what litter I was using, and when I told her Dr. Elsey's Ultra, she told me that could be the issue as it's heavier and more dense than most litters, so when it's at the optimal line, it weighs a lot more.

I swapped it to a different litter and it's working fine, while it's full.  Problem solved.  Here's what surprised me: the new LR4 uses the same litter and hasn't had an issue at all.  I think the newer ones are better equipped to differentiate litter types and make the adjustments.  I have the app updated to show Dr. Elsey's, but the old one still had issues while the new one worked fine.  I'm going to monitor everything for the rest of the day, and if I don't have anymore issues, I'm going to switch our litter autoship at Chewy's.

I hope this helps.  I was pulling my hair out wondering why it wasn't working.  I thought it was because I added the hopper, but I realize that was just coincidentally when I switched the litter.  I was looking for a lower dust litter as the old one was causing one of our cats to sneeze a LOT.",post,2,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/1jz4rf2/fixed_hopefully_lr4_stopping_every_cycle/,Chewy

216,Chewy,chewy autoship,1hz4bow,N/A,2025-01-11,"Am I wrong? AITAH? I don’t need medical advice, but I have been becoming increasingly frustrated with my vets office/staff and I want to know if I’m crazy for being upset. 

For context, I have been seeing my current vet for 4 years and I have 2 dogs and 2 cats. Both of my dogs are on daily, lifelong medications and one of them is also on prescription diet. Point being, I am well aware that regular check ups are necessary to keep up prescriptions. In my 4 years as a client with 4 animals, none of them have ever been behind on they’re regular exams with then only exception being I pushed my young, healthy cats annual back a couple months at one point to make the vet schedule financially more tolerable for myself. I also work as a dog groomer so I know how nasty pet parents can be. I can truly only imagine how nasty people are to vet staff and I always make a point to just be an easy client. 

One of my dogs, Chewy takes thyro tabs and I’ve had them on autoship for almost two years at this point I get 120 tabs for just under 10$ plus 6$ shipping delivered every 8 weeks. On 12/3 my vets office called asking that I schedule Chewys annual so they can fill the script. I was busy at work so I couldn’t do it on the phone at that exact moment, but I did schedule online within a couple of hours and sent a message. The person on the phone was incredibly rude, wouldn’t give me a date of when he needed to be seen and just kept saying it’s been “almost a year” and they wouldn’t fill the script until I had an appointment on the books. When I asked for his exam due date and she couldn’t provide me one she said “it’s not my fault we changed systems”- this becomes important.

I did what was asked and scheduled a morning appointment for 1/6. Rather than send the script through as promised, they canceled it. I had extra pills to last until the appointment though so I never made a fuss. I live 25 minutes away and they called me 15 minutes before my appointment to cancel because the doctor was out sick. I never complained about the doctor being out, as inconvenient as it was for me I recognize that he’s human and life happens. I did complain though because at that point I was really low on meds and needed more and the script had been canceled rather than filled. While there I find out Chewy was due to be seen by 1/29/25 so almost an entire 2 months after they were refusing to fill his meds. I expressed frustration at the script being canceled and I’m told “it’s not my fault the doctor is sick” and “we can’t fill that, it’s not my fault you were given false information”. I mention only having ABOUT a weeks worth of meds left and they take his blood work and say after they get the results they will give me enough to get by until his new appointment on the 28th.

On 1/8 they call me and say they’re going to fill the script. I tell them I will come in the next day or two. At this point I have 2 days of pills left for him and I show up on 1/9. I make yet another trip there to pick up the meds and pay 20$ for 30 tablets. I get to my car only to realize that’s not even enough to get by until the 28th so I got back in. Now, I’m running out of patience. They explain that I said I had about a week left so they intended to give me exactly enough until the 28th but because I didn’t actually have a weeks worth of pills left when I made that estimate, it was short. I’m told “it’s not my fault you said you had a weeks worth of pills”. 

They sell me another 15 pills and charge me 17$! I NEVER complain about prices because I know how annoying and pointless it is, but I do have 4 animals and need to mindful of expenses so needlessly paying 4x the price for less than half the amount is infuriating at this point because I also know now that I will be forced to fill his next script there on the 28th because I won’t have enough at home to wait for it to come through the mail. They tell me there’s a “filling fee” which is why it’s costing me almost the same amount for 14 pills as I just paid for 30 pills. I ask for the fee to be waived, and I’m told “no. It’s not my fault, I don’t make the prices”. I ask for a manager and I’m also told no. I pay the additional 17$ because I literally don’t have a choice at this point. Keep in mind as of this time, my dog is still not over due for an exam!

I have dealt with almost half a dozen different people at this point and every single one of them of them throws their hands up and is so quick to say “it’s not my fault” and time I express any amount of frustration. I feel I’m justified in being frustrated. I’m a patient person and I am kind but I’m truly struggling with this because none of this is my fault either and despite doing what they’ve asked of me at every step along the way and dealing with every single inconvenience I’ve been treated like I’m an asshole for being frustrated. I feel ripped off and betrayed. I’ve never missed an appointment or canceled and again, none of my animals have ever fallen behind on regular checkups. I have a history here and nothing about my pets record would suggest that I won’t show up for this appointment. 

Am I in the wrong here? Am I wrong for being frustrated? Have there been a change to laws that explain why I’ve never had this issue before or better yet, why my other dogs scripts continued get filled with no issues despite him also being due for an annual by 1/29? It’s as if somebody made a mistake somewhere and despite righting it decided to die on the hill and make me pay for it. I wouldn’t be nearly as frustrated if one person would just genuinely apologize and maybe own it but instead all I get is “it’s not my fault” from every single person I’ve interacted with. 

Edit to update: the practice manager called me today (1/13) and it was blatantly obvious where the poor attitudes are coming from. She was very rudely interrupting me and I shut it down because I am now beyond fed up. When I finished she snapped back with “am I allowed to speak now?” and I admittedly finally lost my cool. I called her out on how rude and uncalled for that response was and told her that I can see where everyone’s attitude problem is stemming from. In the end absolutely nothing was resolved. Party because I lost my cool and partly because she seemed to clearly have no interest in taking any responsibility or apologizing regardless. After circular arguments where she refused to acknowledge the fact that as of this moment Chewy is STILL not overdue for an exam. At one point she even started arguing that my other dogs medication was last filled in March 2024 and that is absolutely not true, his medication was actually last filled in December right around when Chewys medication was supposed to be filled (also a 60 day supply). I wish so badly that I would be able to cancel my appointment for both dogs on 1/28 but I know I won’t be able to get them seen elsewhere in time to maintain their prescriptions. 

I appreciate the reassurance I got here because I was feeling so emotional about the situation and with so many people treating me so poorly I was truly wondering if maybe I did do something wrong.",post,4,0.75,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hz4bow/am_i_wrong_aitah/,Chewy

I'm not asking for autoship discounts or CareCredit, I'm just genuinely lost on what the next step will be for my dog. 

Longer version: 

My rescue pit mix is 14 and recently stopped eating her last OTC kibble (American Journey). She's also had diarrhea on and off since November. In addition, she has a history of skin cancer, skin allergies, and anal gland issues. I had her left anal gland removed last year and last night she just had her fourth anal gland abscess. Multiple rounds of antibiotics work for the gland but do not resolve the food issue. 

The vet suspected the diarrhea and lack of eating (but not lack of appetite) was a food allergy, likely with the protein (salmon). She then prescribed Royal Canin HP dry food about a month ago. I was worried about the cost ($135ish for the big 25ish lb bag) but went ahead because she needed it. Apple ate it for maybe two weeks before stopping again. 

Today I took her in for wound care for the most recent abscess and they prescribed us Hill's Canine W/D wet food which is great but much more costly. She loves it but the case of 12 was $65 and at 60 lbs, that's 4 cans a day. So a 6 week trial at ~$22 a day is $924. I can't afford that. Even with a slightly cheaper price at Chewy and with autoship. Do people dogs on this long term or could I (after consulting with my vet) switch her to the more affordable dry version and just add warm water to make it more appealing? I only got the prescription for case and got it directly from the vet, so is this a situation where if it works, they'll automatically switch me to the dry? Will I have an option?

Since then she’s been reclassified as Stage 3 and we have some hope. That also means more  treatment options. She ended up hating the canned kidney care food, so we switched to dry food. Unfortunately this also means fewer fluids, which is why we’ve begun sub-Q fluids.

226,Chewy,chewy vet,1ev2zvo,N/A,2024-08-18,"Chewy online vet chat and cat poison control experience- VERY POSITIVE (TLDR at bottom) Hi everyone, 

I just wanted to bring attention to the experience I had tonight with the cat poison control line and Chewy vet chat. 

This evening, I had left a quarter of my Five Guys burger on my kitchen counter and me and my boyfriend’s cats got to it. Thinking nothing of it, we threw out the remnants and continued with our night. 

After a Google search, my boyfriend had said that onions were toxic to cats and lo and behold, there were diced onions on my burger. 

I saw a comment from someone on this thread that Chewy had a vet chat service available to anyone that has ordered something on there before (NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED- I don’t have a subscription). I typed in my login info to Chewy, got on the vet chat (available 6AM to 12AM eastern standard time).

I filled in my cats information and was connected to a vet tech right away. The vet tech offered to connect me with cat poison control and said that, usually, a consultation with them would cost $80 but if I was connected through the Chewy vet, it would cost $59. I was skeptical, so I called the cat poison control myself and they said yes, it would be $80 for a consultation. 

I then went back to the Chewy vet chat and asked them to connect me with poison control. To my surprise, the vet I was speaking with called me directly and put me through to cat poison control. 

When talking to poison control, the woman was very thorough with me and walked me through what I should do (monitor my cats for the next 24 hours). I gave her my card information up front and was charged $59 instead of the $80. 

I can’t tell you how thorough, thoughtful, and kind these people were when I was talking to them. The woman from poison control even pulled up the ingredients of Five Guys and stated that nothing else my cats ingested were poisonous (bun, pickle, cheese, burger- they’re not made with garlic powder either). She also gave me an idea of how much onion my cats had to eat in order for it to be considered toxic (basically 2 1 1/2-2 inch diameter onion rings- way less than what was on the rest of my burger). 

My boyfriend and I are absolutely still going to monitor our cats (I’ll be pulling an all-nighter out of guilt and anxiety) but I had to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with both Chewy and poison control. 

I understand that $59 is still steep, but it’s a bit better than $80. I’d certainly pay $8,000,000 for our little babies to make sure they’re safe and healthy. I’ve absolutely learned my lesson.

TLDR- I have an overwhelmingly positive experience with the Chewy online vet chat and cat poison control when I discovered my two cats ate the last quarter of my Five Guys burger with onions on it.",post,3,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1ev2zvo/chewy_online_vet_chat_and_cat_poison_control/,Chewy

I’m terrified that I’ve severely damaged her kidneys and I feel horrible.  I have a 14 year old cockapoo that I’ve had since she was 8 weeks old. She’s my entire world. We found out this year she has an autoimmune dermatitis condition after we were unable to cure a horrible ear infection with antibiotics - she still has the infection and this series of vet visits started in March. That has me feeling bad enough, I wish she could understand that I’ve spent over a thousand dollars trying to fix this for her and we’re still working on it. 

Anyway, we started a liquid immunosuppressant medication one month ago, and the bottle was supposed to last at least five months. My mother has been administering the meds because it works best with our schedule, and I taught her to give 3mL because that’s what I thought the box said. Today she told me the bottle is almost empty, which shocked me since I paid $250 for a 5 month supply, and that’s when I realized. It says .3, not 3.

Aside from diarrhea in the evening after taking the medicine, which I was told was probably just her adjusting to the meds by my vet, she has been acting 100% like her normal self. But kidney disease doesn’t show symptoms until stage 3, so that doesn’t mean I didn’t ruin her. She already has a vet appointment in a few days. I talked to a Chewy vet tonight and she recommended I call the office tomorrow and see if we can get labs done right away. 

I guess I’m just looking for comfort or something rather than advice since I won’t know anything until we go to the vet. I’m just gutted. I poisoned my best friend with my careless mistake and made her feel sick every night when I thought I was helping her. And now I just have to hope she doesn’t pay the ultimate price for my stupidity. ",post,639,0.97,84,https://i.redd.it/f7n8nm0ve3qd1.jpeg,Chewy

Went to a new vet yesterday with my pup. (It’s actually my old vet I loved, but she apparently retired and sold it to a new guy-and did not let me know- strike 1) He asked if my pup was purebred and I said yes. Told me to be sure I should get a Wisdom test. I have AKC records of four generations back-all purebred. Side eye by vet given- strike 2. Then said the wisdom test will check for hundreds of disease markers that I can then “pre-treat“. Charges $550 for the test. Is it worth it? Any difference between the $550 one and the $129 one on chewy? 

Strikes 3,4,5,and 6- wore rubber gloves- they were obviously dirty. Did not introduce himself or shake my hand. (I’m old-it’s a big deal for me) Minimal eye contact. Tried to sell me anti microbial wipes for $45- same ones $12 on chewy. Really pushed the wisdom test. Appointment was at 10, in room at 10:15 and did not see him until 10:30 with no mention of being late. Never spoke to my pup and never asked her name. Might be shopping for a new vet.

I miss her dearly and always look back at those memories laughing - she was a silly girl who just hated medicine! 😆🤣).

But Chewi? Literally perfection. A blessing. He gets all excited because he thinks it’s a treat, starts doing little tricks for it, takes the pill and eats it right up. Even with his pain meds too - no issues. I mentioned this to my vet when I brought him today for his follow-up, and the vet said it’s because he truly trusts me and knows the meds are helping him get better.

Took him to the vet and they said I came in good time to treat his, what they said, was either a UTI or a eaaaarrrlllyyy blockage. And thankfully the meds worked and it was fine for a whole year until a couple days ago I noticed him straining again. I thought I would just keep an eye on it but then in the morning I noticed he peed in the tub (which that alone isn’t normal behavior for him he always goes in his litter box or his brothers) and I saw it looked slightly pinkish so I just took him to the vet. I’m not gonna lie I really didn’t connect or appreciate the vet and some of his responses but okay yeah we went ahead and did an ultrasound and we didn’t see anything besides him saying my cats bladder was like 1.4 cm “bigger” than it should be (it was a 2.2). He said he wanted to do blood work and urine analysis but as much as it pains me to even type this, I just don’t have a lot of extra money right now so I ended up getting him a few cans of rfce Urinary S/O food (they wanted me to buy a 7.7 bag of the kibble for 72 dollars and I just don’t think that seemed right, but idk I still have to look into what is the best options in vendors with good price / weight ), 10 days worth of Orbax , and three measly little pills for pain for the next three days. I’m monitoring him and he is still mostly acting normal , he still jumped on the window and did his bird watching , still is eating and drinking normally , still cuddling with me.  But right before I started typing this he peed on a bag in front of me and this gray mushy stuff came out. Wondering if anyone can tell me what exactly it is ? If this is good that it’s coming out ? Is it something I need to act on asap? I’m so terrified of losing my best friend. Literally anything helps , if anyone knows maybe some natural remedies ? Some food recommendations?

GSDs is a super picky eater. i've seen the advice to take away their food and wait for them to learn that if they're hungry, they'll need to eat what's given to them. however, rosie lost weight from the stress of being in foster care for a few months, and she needs to gain about 10 pounds to be at a healthier weight (my vet's advice). so, i'm not comfortable doing something that could make her _lose_ weight.

she now eats [pro plan sensitive skin and stomach](https://www.chewy.com/purina-pro-plan-sensitive-skin/dp/1064462?utm_source=app-share&utm_campaign=1064462) kibble, with whatever toppings it takes to get her to eat it. unsurprisingly, she's got a super sensitive digestive system and gets diarrhea very easily if i'm not careful. (i do have a pumpkin supplement for her to help with this.) i always feed her _after_ we exercise to avoid bloat and ensure she's at least theoretically hungry.

i could write an entire essay on the things i've mixed into her kibble to get her to eat it. the ""acceptable"" ones are cheese and chicken (freeze dried, jerky, home cooked, doesn't matter as long as it's chicken). i have to sit with her the whole time she eats and keep adding more of whatever topping to get her to keep eating. it's a 20 minute battle every meal. and, she never seems to want to go back to a topping we've previously tried. so far it has been various forms of chicken and cheese, some more healthy than others.

i don't mind adding the toppings, but it would be nice if we could find a reliable few to rotate instead of continuously trying something new. i'm going to run out of ""acceptable"" toppings eventually lol. i'm not sure what else to do other than transitioning her kibble. but i'm open to any advice y'all may have! thanks in advance!!!",post,56,0.97,58,https://i.redd.it/t620o3wh91xe1.jpeg,Chewy

238,Chewy,chewy vet,1jhc6nh,N/A,2025-03-22,"How my mom thrives on her SS of $1900 a month in a HCOL town I saw this subreddit mentioned on the SocialSecurity subreddit. I thought that I would help by telling you all how my mother lives on her SS income.

**TL/DR version**: >!She lives rent-free by buying into a home with her son’s family in coastal San Diego.!<

My mother is an 84-year-old widow. She gets approximately $1900 a month in SS benefits. She is in moderate health, with arthritis, and heart issues. Her mind is sharp.

She lives a wonderful, full, and comfortable life. She has very little stress. I think she is satisfied with her personal situation. Here is how she did it.

**Her SS History**

At age 60 she semi-retired. She started collecting her SS survivor benefit. She left her full-time, high stress management job. Sold the house. She moved to Arizona and bought a smaller home with a small mortgage. She worked part time at a low stress job at a resort. Between the SS survivor benefit, her part time job, and her lower cost of living, she did fine. She had a yard to grow her garden in and the time to attend to it. She was able to pay off the mortgage by age 70 and buy herself a small used RV.

At age 70 she retired. She switched to her own SS retirement benefits. She moved into the RV and rented out her house. She then spent the next few years on the road travelling. She visited every state, and most of Canada. She caught up with friends and family all over the country. [She kept a blog about how she did it](https://sailingdowntheroad.blogspot.com/). And how she travelled on such a tight budget.

The keys were planning and keeping it simple. In her 60’s while working part time she did a lot of homework on how to do this RV trip. When she hit the road at age 70, she was ready to go. This RV trip in retirement is worth a separate thread.

**Combining Households**

My wife and I live and work in San Diego. Around 2016 we were looking to upgrade into a house or larger home from the condo we were living in. So, I proposed a plan to my mother. I suggested that we create a multi-generational household for us. That we combine forces and buy a home that is large enough for all of us. It would allow us to help her as she aged. It would allow her to help us buy a home in expensive San Diego. And it would allow her to have housing without the stress of rent or ownership.

She sold her house in Arizona and gifted me the money as part of the down payment. We sold our homes. And that gave us a large enough downpayment that we were able to shop and compete for homes in an expensive market that met our requirements. It was not easy. But we finally found the perfect house in Encinitas. It is in coastal San Diego County. It has ground floor granny unit. 4 bedroom/3 bath. Walking distance to the beach and downtown Encinitas. Close the hospital, medical, shopping, library, restaurants, and everything my mom could want.

We bought the house. Mom has lived with us for several years now. She still has her RV. I found a house a mile away that has an RV parking pad that they rented to her. She still takes RV trips, but shorter ones. Usually less than 2 months.

**How it works for her**

For her, she doesn’t have any housing expenses. We don’t charge her for any utilities. We all agreed that her contribution to the downpayment entitled her to a place to live for life. It is not like it costs us a lot because she lives here. The internet bill would be the same. The water and gas would be about the same. I had solar installed, so our electric bill is only about $10 a month. It is not worth bothering her about something that small.

Her health has started to decline since he hit 80. Her arthritis prevents her from doing a lot of things on her own now. Living with us allows us to help her. I make her bed because she can no longer do it herself. We do her laundry because she struggles climbing the stairs to the second floor. I take care of her car and her RV when things need to be fixed. I take care of her laptop and iPad and phone. When she is sick or not feeling well, we have dinner ready for her.

Her life here with us seems pleasant. She has a group of friends she sees regularly. She has own private bedroom and bathroom in the house that we respect. It’s her home. Her space. It’s off the side, like a granny unit. Her and her dog live there.  We have a little park at the end of the block where she likes to take her dog too.

A few blocks away is a larger park with a dog park. She loves the library, which is a few blocks away. And the senior center is not far either. She will meet her friends downtown for lunch. Or take herself to the beach.

The train station is very close to the house. I’ve tried teaching her how to use it. She could take to train to downtown San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles. But she struggles to master it.

Her only complaint about living with us is that it is cold here. Because she is on the ground floor, and it is often foggy in the mornings being this close to the beach, it never gets hot here at our house. I put a heater in her room to help with this.

**How it works for us**

It is a win for us too. We have a live in house sitter and pet sitter for when we travel. That is a great relief for us because it allows us freedom without worrying about our pets at home. She cooks dinner once a week, which is great. She is a good cook. It gives my wife a break. And we enjoy what she creates. She takes care of our garden for us because she loves gardening. I hate gardening. I don’t mind at all.

A couple of times a month we have a movie night in the living room. We will pick a movie we all want to see. I will make popcorn for everyone. It’s nice to have these new traditions.

And we have a free airport shuttle, as long as it is daylight hours. She doesn’t drive at night anymore.

It is a win for my siblings too. They live in other states. Neither of them is able to have our mom live with them if she needs to be looked after. They are very happy that she is living here with us and that she is looked after and safe.

**Why This Works**

This works for us because we have some factors that are aligned in our favor. So obviously what works here won't work for everyone.

* My mother is not married or in a relationship. I don't think that this would work as well if it were a couple living in the granny unit. In a house this size it would require a detached granny unit.
* My wife and my mother get along. They have their differences of course. But my wife loves my mom. And my mom loves my wife. They respect each other. If you don't have that, then this can't work.
* There are no toxic addictions poisoning relationships. No one is getting drunk, high, stoned, and causing chaos at our house. It's hard to live with someone who has an addiction.
* My siblings are onboard with the arrangement. My mother invested their inheritance into our house. They are okay with that because they each own their own homes. I've planned to pay them their share after mom's death from equity and our savings. We put that in writing before we bought the house, with a payment schedule. I can get into details on how I made that work in another post. It's a bit complicated. But it can work.

**Her budget:**

**Healthcare:** She pays for Medicare Part B. She pays for supplemental insurance. She pays for Part D. All up, I think this costs her around $500 a month.

**Rent.** She does pay some rent. But not to us.

Storage Unit - $100 a month.

When she sold her house, she downsized from a home, into one bedroom and bathroom. That meant a lifetime of stuff that she had to do something with. Because she had rented her house out in Arizona when she took off in her RV, most of it went into storage. Later the rest of it went into storge when she sold the house.

Years later, most of it is gone. Sold, donated, or trashed. But there is still more to sort through. She has a rental space down the road. I bring her boxes to sort through from it about once a month and she slowly makes decisions on things.

RV parking pad- $100 a month

**Dog:** She has a dog that she spoils. I have no idea. Between dog food, treats, toys, vet bills, etc. $1M a month? I’m kidding. I’d guess $200 a month. I don’t know exactly. I just see lots of boxes from Chewy on the doorstep every week and a very happy dog.

**Cars**: She has a car and the RV. Between fuel, insurance, and registration, I guess this costs her about $150 a month.

**Entertainment:** She pays for a couple of TV streaming services. About $30 a month.

**Cellular Service:** $10 a month. She is on my family plan.

**Dining:** She likes to have lunch with her friends at least once or twice a week. $250 a month?

**Groceries:** $150 maybe? She rarely buys groceries. My wife and I always cook enough for all of us. We don’t even think about it. My wife doesn't work outside the home. And is an excellent cook. She makes most of our meals at home from scratch as healthy as she can. And I BBQ too. So it is no problem cooking for the whole family.

My mom harvests fruit and vegetables from our backyard garden that she maintains. We are grateful for that. I don't mind doing the heavy lifting for her, such as moving bags of topsoil, heavy potted plants. Or climbing the trees to harvest the oranges and figs.

**Travel:** This is her fun money. Whatever is left goes to travel. She goes on RV trips. She flies to Hawaii & Alaska. She has been on some cruises. Lately, her and her sister have been taking river cruises. They did the Columbia River last year.",post,69,0.99,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingOnSS/comments/1jhc6nh/how_my_mom_thrives_on_her_ss_of_1900_a_month_in_a/,Chewy

240,Chewy,chewy vet,1k7dn6t,N/A,2025-04-25,"Behavioral euthanasia for a dog. Longtime lurker here.

This is going to be a NOVEL, so here’s a TL;DR ahead of the post: Great Dane has been terrorizing our older dog for years. Tonight was another bloody fight and I’m so scared my sweet little girls could end up injured or worse if they get caught in the middle one day. We’ve exhausted all our options and are now considering behavioral euthanasia. Feeling like a bad person for even letting it cross my mind but struggling to come up with any other solution 💔

-

I have two girls - a 2yo and a 5mo. I also have 3 dogs. One of which is a Great Dane. He is the biggest asshole on the planet but we’ve loved him since day one. He started fighting with our older dog maybe 9 months after we got him in 2021. These are intense and bloody fights. We’ve been walking on eggshells for years, wondering when the next fight would happen. They’ve typically been every ~6 months but the most recent one had been maybe 2 or 3 months ago and then there was another tonight. We have a girl dog who’s older than him but he’s scared of her lol so there’s no problem between them. She definitely rules the roost.

I’m absolutely sick over this. We’ve contacted his breeder and asked her to take him back. She will not. I’ve asked every rescue and sanctuary I could find, Great Dane-specific and not. No one will take him due to his behavior toward my other dog. His bite history is pretty bad when it comes to our older dog. He’s left deep puncture wounds, ripped his ears, bloodied his eye, nearly broke bones in his paws. Even our local humane society said hell no to him. I’ve posted him on Facebook (asking for a rehoming fee and vet check), specifying he’s dog-aggressive and would need to be the only pet in a home. No one is interested in a 160lb dog who’s wounded another animal many times.

We’ve tried trainers, medication, a behavioral specialist. The latter actually came to our home 2 years ago to observe the dogs together and within 30 minutes very confidently told us they would never be able to live together happily. Our Great Dane just bullies our older dog nonstop. No amount of time or money spent on him has helped. Our dogs can’t have treats because of the potential for a fight. They can’t have bones or chewy toys. They have no enrichment because it sets our Great Dane on edge and causes him to act aggressive toward our older dog. And now with our extremely needy 5mo, we would have no time to dedicate to attempting training him again. I can’t even take a 15 minute shower without her screaming bloody murder for me.

I feel we’re trapped. We can’t keep them separate. We don’t have the space and it’s unfair to deprive one dog or the other from family time. I don’t have the time to split between them. And honestly? I don’t fucking want to deal with him anymore. It’s been years of waiting and wondering when it’ll happen again. Getting lulled into a false sense of “maybe that was the last time and everything is cool now”. I just want to be done with him. After tonight, I’m terrified of the idea of my girls accidentally getting caught in the middle of a fight. Our dogs LOVE the girls, even our Great Dane. They’re exceptionally gentle and affectionate toward them. Of course they’re literally never left alone near the kids ever under any circumstances, but now especially, it makes me wonder what could happen in the future when they’re both 5+, roaming freely around the home without us capable of constantly watching. What if they would get stuck in the crossfire of a random, unpredictable fight? I cry just thinking about it.

So anyway. I’m calling the vet in the morning to discuss behavioral euthanasia. I’m guilt-ridden, heartbroken, and just destroyed over even considering it. But I truly feel out of options. My husband said it has to be done because no one is going to take him and even if they do, who’s to say he’ll never come across another dog and kill it? I’m sure the only reason our other dog is still alive is because he’s also a large breed and very sturdy. One little bite from a Great Dane could kill a smaller dog in a split second. That would make me feel even guiltier.

I don’t know why I’m posting here. I guess because no one will (hopefully) judge me too much. I have no one else to talk to besides my mom. She has witnessed two of their fights, including tonight’s, and told me he needs to go immediately.

Anyway. I’m going to stay awake all night crying while nursing my baby and comforting my injured older dog. Am I a terrible person for considering behavioral euthanasia?

EDIT: We said goodbye to our boy today around 1:30pm. I am completely heartbroken and have been crying all day. Thank you to everyone for your very kind replies. I’ve been questioning whether we did the right thing and reading through the responses here has made me feel just a slight bit better, although I don’t think I’ll ever get over this or forgive myself. We made his last afternoon as special as we could and the vet staff was extremely kind and understanding.

So, my cats have been eating Hydrolyzed Protein dry kibble for 1.5 years without issue until shortly after I bought a new bag in August from Chewy. Something seemed 'off' but I didn't have any of the old kibble to compare. My cats seemed a little less enthusiastic about eating it but they did. 

Long story short is that it seems to have made both of my cats sick but we didn't pin it on the food at first because they got sick at different times and one has health issues with IBD/IBS already. Around the time one cat stopped eating for 4 days I had to force feed her and take her to the vet, the other began vomiting. It clicked maybe the food may be the issue after her vet exam and labs came back clean ($800). 

I bought a new bag which came today and the kibble is notably different by sight and smell. This is frustrating and worrisome since this is an expensive medically prescribed product.

I've already sent Royal Canin an email but wanted to ask, has anyone else has had an issue like this recently? 

Does Royal Canin use the same shape for their different kibble formulas? I tried them on the Selected Protein PR before the Hydrolyzed and feel it was a different shape.

Naturally, my cat was just diagnosed with a hyperthyroid which will need lifelong meds and, at least, biannual visits to monitor him. I can work some magic to afford the $7 monthly generic meds on chewy but I 100% cannot afford two $375 vet bills a year, not including *any* of his other care or emergency visits. 

My mother, who lives in south jersey. Said $375 sounded a little high. I know places are more expensive in the city and I obviously want the best for me cat and have been willing to go into more debt bringing him somewhere highly rated but...the money simply does not exist and it will not. Not next week, nor the week after that. I considered rehoming him to a family who can better care for his senior needs but after ten years with him I just can't do it. 

He is my literal best friend and I'm mainly all he knows. I can't do that. I don't want to change vets but need to be realistic about my budget and unstable financial future. I wish I could give him the best without a second thought to cost but that's not my life. So I'm hoping to hear from other cat owners on a painfully strict budget in south philly where you take your pets, especially if you've dealt with hyperthyroid related treatment and bills there. 

Edit: Thanks for the recommendations everyone. I'll be looking into them this coming week. Also want to reiterate that both Companion and City Cats are awesome, just currently out of my price range!

244,Chewy,chewy vet,1jvas1z,N/A,2025-04-09,"Bandit Update Trying this again as apparent none of the pictures worked on the previous post?


I'm copy pasting some of this from the most recent GoFundMe update. I won't be posting the GoFundMe as the mods seemed weird about it last time, some saying it was fine, others not, you can find that on your own if you want to donate, or you can DM me for it.  


I was asked to update with information on what's going on with Bandit after the last post a month or so ago. So here goes.  
   
  
He was brought into an emergency vet early in March that I hadn't done my research on (I was in a panic) and found out they're notorious for overcharging. They wanted 12,500 to begin any sort of treatment from Bandit. I couldn't afford that, went into the lobby to get the original post and GoFundMe started. I took him home that night, and thought I was watching him die, so I did as recommended and called two other places to get second opinions. One place would begin treatment with only 75% down, and I brought him there the following day. I didn't qualify for loans or Carecredit so I had to get even that amount loaned to me from someone I know IRL while the GFM spun up.  


That day and the following day he received his blood transfusion, an iron test, some imaging test of some sort to check for ulcers and such, he had fluid in his abdomen that they extracted and sent for testing, and he began a treatment plan of prednisone and doxycycline. I admit I fucked up here and misunderstood what they meant when they doubled his dosage of prednisone, I thought they doubled the dosage of the pills themselves, I was supposed to be giving him twice the amount.  
 

He came home and did well for a while, and all the tests came back inconclusive. The next step was a bone marrow biopsy, he went in for that, did well, came out and was able to come home. At that point I was told him blood cell count was holding what it was the night of the transfusion before I brought him home (14%)  


The following week I fought with myself about whether he was doing well or not. I couldn't trust myself (this is three weeks of fucked up sleep and pretty much permanent panic) about what the color his tongue was and whether his energy levels seemed the same or different, he just had part of his bone removed after all, of course his he's not gonna be energetic. At this point his poops I will say were pale in color and very not solid, which should have been an indicator but he was on so many medicines and I was so unsure if I could trust myself. By the end of the week he was refusing chicken, and that was not normal, so off to the vet we went again, they did a blood draw while I was there and determined he needed another blood transfusion, and they said they were going to put him on another medication, cyclosporine, to suppress his immune system as they had seen, but could not confirm without the biopsy, that in the aspirate he seemed to be beginning the process of making red blood cells.  


He came home the following day, which was last week... Something. The days are blending together. 

  
Then I got the call from the vet yesterday, I didn't want to update yesterday for some reason, maybe I was afraid I was dreaming and would wake up.  Along with prednisone and cyclosporine he is still taking doxycycline (an antibiotic) that he'll be finishing tomorrow and he was put on cerenia for nausea, I think.  
  
  
Yesterday they said that they received his results from the bone marrow biopsy and they corroborated what the aspirate said, he was beginning to produce his red blood cells but they were being destroyed somewhere along the way. The doctor said that the treatment he was started on post blood transfusion is appropriate for treating this, and he'll continue this medication for the foreseeable future. There is a possibility he may need another blood transfusion if he doesn't respond right away, and at this point my credit cards are maxed except one that has $100 left and we've exceeded the funds gotten by the GoFundMe. I'm just increasing our goal to cover the possibility of the blood transfusion, and if he doesn't need it the funds will be to cover his medicine. The cyclosporine from the hospital is $112 per 7.5 day dose, $65 from Chewy, which is considerably more manageable.   
  
  
His diagnosis is Precursor-targeted Immune Mediated Anemia. He seems to be responding to the medication currently, but at this point it's important to be prepared in case he needs the blood transfusion. They're unsure what caused him to develop it but it is an autoimmune disease and sometimes you just don't know with those.  


I want to end this on a positive note though, yesterday we went on two full walks, one one block in the morning, his poops are the correct color and are relatively solid, and at night, we went on two blocks at his insistence. He also walks down the stairs when we go outside, and will try to walk up the stairs when we get back but that might still be too much for his leg where he got the biopsy as he gets up one and a half flights, but I don't mind carrying him the rest. He's playful, I caught him playing with a toy, very briefly I think, I got him in to briefly chase a long piece of packaging paper, he tried to jump on the bed last night, he chirps at me to get up and walk him in the morning, he insists he's too good to eat just kibble now, he requires kibble, chicken and cheese in his daily rotation, he got ground turkey yesterday instead of chicken and was more than excited to perform tricks to obtain it, even trotting with great speed when I called him over. When we're walking his seems to have more energy, frequently walking ahead of me like he used to.   
  
  
Thank you again to everyone for all of your help, donations, sharing the GoFundMe, assisting with getting Bandit to and from the vet the many times we've gone, and the many other ways people have helped. Hopefully we reach this last stretch goal soon, and even if not, I look forward to telling everyone about Bandit's progress.

At their old vet, I always got their monthly tick/flea preventative through Chewy’s pharmacy, which had to be approved by the vet, then Chewy would ship it. I submitted my request through Chewy for their tick/flea preventative and routed it through the new vet. The new vet called me and said they do not work with Chewy’s pharmacy since it isn’t legitimate and there is no way to know if the medications they provide are real or fake. I inquired more and was told their lead doctor “follows the rules” and they are not allowed to use Chewy pharmacy. I’ve used the Chewy pharmacy for 4+ years now and have never had an issue.

But reading reviews on Chewy have me nervous about their shipping practices. 

Lots of reviews saying that cans arrive not just dented, but also bulging or with broken seals. Sometimes a foul odor or weird texture. This is considtent over several different brands on Chewy's website. 

It seems like people who buy the same brands from elsewhere don't report these problems nearly as much, but it's hard to tell which reviews are honest these days.

248,Chewy,chewy vet,1j6mkyc,N/A,2025-03-08,"8mo female starving herself to death - HELP Quick update; thank you so much to everyone for commenting! It is quite late where I live so I will be reading through and responding tomorrow. Baby still hasn’t eaten, we have offered chicken liver, boiled chicken breast, tuna for the cats, cat kibble, cat paste, dog biscuits (plain and chicken liver ones), pumpkin peanutbutter treats, butternut, pumpkin, mcdonalds chicken patty, mcdonalds beef patty and dried venison sausage (it’s like beef jerky almost but made from antelope). Most of this she normally eats or even loves, but the only thing she took now, even though she has never actually had it before, was the beef patty. I am well aware that it isn’t ideal but we are at our wits end. She literally sniffles the patty, bites a piece off, drops it on the floor, bites another piece off, drops it on the floor, and so on, without actually eating anything. Will be trying bread tomorrow morning and see how that goes. She is still drinking fortunately, so at least that is good. We did a short, slow walk as well, just through the street, and she loved it, but still didn’t eat afterwards. If she’s not eating by monday she will have to be hospitalised because then it has been a week :(

Hi, I am new to the sub, but desperate. I’ve been lurking and trying to find anyone in a similar situation or with similar experiences.

Our 8 month old female husky was spayed on monday (3 March). She ate normal dinner before the spay, and essentially hasn’t eaten properly since. Over the past week we have tried to offer her anything we can to get her to eat. Being nauseous for 1-2 days we can understand, but for the whole week seems excessive. She has eaten a cooked chicken fillet, 2 chewy sticks and 2 small packets of wet cat food since Sunday. We have offered healthy food that she normally loves, unhealthy food (like chicken nuggets even), treats, etc. literally anything we can. We are desperate. 

She is interested and sniffles the food. Sometimes she puts it in her mouth and then drops it. When opening a treat packet she also looks interested but refuses to eat.

Before the whole ordeal she was a fussy eater, and she would definitely wait for my mom to mix canned cat tuna through her dry kibble before eating it, but she now hasn’t eaten any kibble for a week. We’ve offered chicken livers, chicken breast, mince, pumpkin, sausage things, tiny slice of hotdog, etc. she refuses it all. 

We have taken her to the vet, today also, who thinks it might be food aversion, due to emotional stress, from going to the vet to be spayed and then on Wednesday she felt very cold so she also went to the vet and had to stay there. So the vet today said maybe it is emotional. She has also been very anxious, running away from my mom, etc. and hasn’t been walked properly. She is used to 2x a day 1h walk, but it wasn’t allowed because of the surgery. 

So the vet gave antibiotics and pain injection, because she hasn’t been eating so we haven’t been able to give her pills. Then she also gave valium for the anxiety and to hopefully increase appetite, so she got her first valium earlier today, still not eating or taking treats etc. 

We are so worried about her and I just wanted to see if anyone else has been through similar situations or has any other theories of what we can try or what this can be? We are really so desperate and my mom has been crying already because we lost 3 animals last year and we don’t want to lose our little girl.",post,45,0.92,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/husky/comments/1j6mkyc/8mo_female_starving_herself_to_death_help/,Chewy
249,Chewy,chewy vet,1dm0mcu,N/A,2024-06-22,"My cat has a chest tube Hi! This is my first time posting here. I think this a bit of an unusual situation so I wanted to share it with you all. I am marking this as uplifting, because I view it that way, but it’s not completely positive.  

My cat Echo is almost 16 and has both heart failure and newly diagnosed kidney disease. He was diagnosed with heart failure last year in June and had to be hospitalized for a few days for pulmonary edema. He recovered great and continued to do well, our vet said he didn’t need to continue on medication as he was stable. (He probably should have stayed on meds but oh well)

Last month on May 6th he had an episode of respiratory distress requiring hospitalization, and was found to have pleural effusions this time (fluid between the lung and pleural cavity) as well as pulmonary edema. He was also newly diagnosed with kidney disease despite his labs being perfect just two weeks prior. He had just had his yearly checkup including an echocardiogram and everything looked good. 

After the three day hospitalization where they did two thoracentesises we met with a cardiologist to have an echocardiogram done, he told us his presentation isn’t typical for cats, he has valve damage but it isn’t degenerative. The theory is he likely had a blood clot when he had his leg amputated many years ago that caused damage to his heart. We discussed treatment but basically he said his condition is very poor and little will likely work, we could have days to weeks. He has both congestive and restrictive heart failure as well as pulmonary hypertension. He had a lot of fluid around his heart and lungs and it would continue to come back. 

Thankfully we got all of his care in Tijuana, and they offered us the option of placing an indwelling chest tube that I could manually remove fluid at home. I have never heard of that being done in the US. I am sure it is cost prohibitive, and high liability to send them home with one. It is a palliative treatment, it won’t cure anything, but drowning alive is no way to die.

On May 29th I noticed he was a bit heavier and seemed to be breathing a bit worse so I decided it was time for the chest tube. They ended up taking 220mls of fluid off! That’s a ton considering he weighs 6.5lbs. 

He has now had his chest tube for a bit over three weeks and is doing amazing! He is eating and drinking, purring and being social. He is usually very picky but loves his new kidney diet. I have started him on kidney supplements and of course phosphorus binder. 

I know we likely still have very little time left, but considering he’s stable and happy right now every little bit feels like a gift. 

I am an RN so taking care of his chest tube isn’t too bad. We clean it with Chlorhexidine daily, put a drain gauze there, and wrap him up. He doesn’t mind the tube or having to wear T-shirts haha. I’ve found I need to wrap him a bit at his belly as well or the fluid will start to accumulate there as well. I drain his tube about twice a day and it’s still putting out a lot. About 30-60ml a day. He doesn’t love that because it’s a bit positional so I have to squeeze him a bit to try and move the pockets of fluid around hahaha. We may try another diuretic but it’s hard because of the kidney disease. 

Fun fact, most cats have a channel between their lungs unlike humans so you can drain the fluid from both sides even with just one tube.  

He takes meds twice a day, no problem with a pill shooter. Thankfully the ones from chewy are all tiny so I place them in one little chicken flavored capsule to make it easy. He takes Lasix for the fluid, Sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, Pimobendan for heart failure, and plavix for cardiac hypertrophy. 

I wanted to share his story with you all, as I find it rather interesting, but also to express how grateful I am to have extra time with him. Standard in the US would be euthanasia for this situation, but even when he wasn’t doing well, he was always happy, and he def wasn’t ready to go.

It seems like a lot of work/stress, but really it’s only a few minutes out of every day. I’m just so grateful to be able to have this time with him, I know it’s extremely limited, and I’m thankful in a way to be able to know that his time is coming to an end. I’m able to be completely present with him, and cherish every moment. He is allowed to do anything he wants haha. He gets plenty of churus, he gets to try a bite of all my food, and if he doesn’t want to come out from under the bed for his meds-hey that’s his right. 

I am also very grateful to have gotten his veterinary care in Mexico. His three day hospitalization was $684, his cardiologist was $225 and his chest tube placement and one night hospital sptial stay was $590. His last follow up appt was $8. We do not live very close to Tijuana so it was a struggle making so many trips but very worth it. We both lived in central Mexico for the last two years before this so it was a no brainer. Including all of his meds, food, supplies we are still under $2k for all of this. While that is very expensive, it doesn’t come close to the cost in the US. I would not be able to have made these choices if we didn’t have the option to go to Tijuana. He is also a very well behaved cat, and being a nurse his care is much more manageable than it would be for most.

I know this story isn’t exactly positive, I still wish he could live to be 22, but 16 years is a good life. He’s so happy and doing so well right now, he’s pain free and if any of that changes I will of course prioritize his comfort. But I can say I truly did everything I could. I love my little hospice baby, and I feel privileged to be able to take care of him and have this time with him.

On the off chance it is being prescribed… Are any of you in outpatient pharmacies actually seeing scripts for ivermectin and mebendazole?? And if so… does the dose match the indication (assuming they’re putting an indication of a helminth infection they don’t have since “cancer” isn’t a valid indication)?

My husband and I both work a lot of hours and have a toddler, so we are looking for ways to reduce consumption that are not extremely time intensive. Examples of things we have done so far: 

- stopped random target trips for stuff we don’t need. 
- we don’t buy seasonal decor, candles, holiday themed stuff (and never really did) 
- we try to meal prep and avoid food waste by planning our meals and sticking to a list. We still order 1-2 days a week. 
- we utilize our town’s buy nothing group to donate things we have outgrown and also pick up stuff for our toddler. 
- no online browsing - we buy with intention when we actually need something. 
- cut back on some streaming services. We share the rest with my family. 

But, it still feels like we consume a lot. Most months we have packages coming at least twice a week between Chewy (for the dog), diaper subscription, medication, household essentials (this week it was light bulbs and caulk for our bathroom) and cleaning products that we actually go through each month, etc. We also still have to utilize dry cleaning, grocery pickup, and other services. We get hand me downs for our toddler from her cousins, but end up needing to buy some stuff each season. 

Are there other “easy” things we can do? How are people with kids reducing consumption? It feels impossible.

My dog's allergies have gotten *so bad* this year that not only is he taking Zyrtec once a day, but now Apoquel too (he itched himself into a small skin infection). UGH. For reference, he's about 30lbs.

Does anybody else here have to give their dog Apoquel? That stuff is obscenely expensive; even at Costco it's $82/mo, but I can't just let him itch himself raw that's wrong. It seems to be wholly environmental because he doesn't have it during the winter, even when winter is mild.

I'm either looking for cheaper alternatives or the vet suggested every other day, but I'm afraid that won't work and he'll still itch himself senseless the off days - he's miserable without.

I thought maybe I could get the 16mg and cut them in half but the vet said that's too much medicine based on his weight, so I'm stuck buying the 5.4mg tablets.

I've looked at Chewy's pharmacy, Kroger doesn't carry it, Costco is still $82 and the vet is no cheaper. Maybe I'll only have to give it during the spring / fall months? This is uncharted territory for me and I'm hoping someone else local to the area, has thoughts on the situation.

The correct dose of Benadryl (25mg/2-3x a day) knocks him out cold and a half dose doesn't do nearly enough, so that's a no go unfortunately.

My dog was recently diagnosed with a perianal fistula, and we are being told his medication will cost $240 dollars a month. The same medications are on Chewy Pharmacy and other online pharmacies for a little over 100 dollars for the first order and 172 thereafter. We are struggling like everyone out there and just cannot afford the 240 a month. However, I would need three separate prescriptions and my vet is saying they will not prescribe written prescription and for every prescription refill from another pharmacy I’d have to pay my vet 20 dollars. Is this even allowed? I always thought pharmacy choice was allowed and encouraged. I feel like this is a cash grab and I’m just so stressed financially; we just put 600 dollars on credit to get his biopsy done to diagnose the fistula. 

Here’s the text message I got from the vet: 

If you would like to go through 3rd party pharmacies we do have to have you come in and sign the online prescription care waiver form. You would need to pay a $20 processing fee each time you would need a prescription refilled before it would get approved. We do not give written prescriptions but you can certainly put in a request for the medication.

EDIT: I don’t understand people fiercely defending this practice and downvoting people’s comments who aren’t favorable of it lol. It’s OKAY if I don’t want to spend an extra 60 dollars when I refill medication. That being said, I appreciate all the genuine advice.

We brought our cats to the vet on Wednesday to get their yearly check up (rabies, distemper, physical).

we had noticed about maybe a month or so prior that my eight-year-old cat, smokes, had been losing weight and seemed skinnier than she should, and was also struggling to eat. We figured she had a couple problems with her teeth, but we also had her on diet food because we accidentally let her balloon up to 13 pounds . We then put her on diet food for about a year and a half so when she got down to around 7 pounds. We were like well, this is how much she weighed when we got her (she was four), so maybe we just forgot what skinny looked like because she was so chunky for a while, lol. We knew she had her yearly pet appointment coming up anyway, so we decided to wait.

when we did get her to the vet, they checked her teeth and said she had two that would need to be taken out. They said they wanted to do bloodwork because she was dehydrated, and they were going to have to screen her anyway before putting her under anesthesia for a tooth surgery. The next day they come back and tell us our cat is in stage for a kidney failure, cannot get tooth surgery, and we have a pharmacies worth of medicine right now and we are struggling to get her to take them.

she is currently on subcutaneous fluids twice a day – this has gotten better and does not seem to be a huge issue as long as we are bribing her with greenies. The chewy middle ones, to make it easier for her to eat. 

She was put on an antibiotic twice a day, for the teeth problem, but she has started not eating her pill pockets, and she is not receptive to a pill shooter, and we worry about prying, her mouth open, trying to get her to take it because of her teeth :-(

She does not like her prescription cat food. 

She is a nephrodyl once a day that we try mixing into her food. Yesterday we blended up her food into a puree and mixed it in and gave it to her via syringe (that she licked off, we didn’t have to hold her mouth open). She mostly hates it but again she fights anything regarding holding her mouth open for a pill shooter. 

she is also on the Rena plus gel, and if that is put in her food, she absolutely will not eat her food but again, we cannot get her to keep her mouth open and stop freaking out. If we mix it into her food, she will not eat it. 

I am freaking out. I cannot get her to eat her food or two or three of her medication‘s at any given time. It’s inconsistent every day. Today I was desperate enough to try purring her food and some greenies in the food processor hoping it would make her eat it. Did not work. 

I am hoping for any tips, we will do anything for her, but it’s like she can suss out whenever there’s a medication in her food and once she figures that out she will not eat it at all. On top of it, we have another cat that is fighting to try to eat her food because it smells better than her food but obviously she can’t eat it because there is medication in it. We are very overwhelmed and I am at my wits end already and I know we still have a long road ahead of us. ",post,46,0.98,27,https://i.redd.it/w7ibn3zosjee1.jpeg,Chewy

When I submit the request to chewy 2 weeks before I need it, that should be plenty of time right? Nope. I've cut it close too many times and am wondering - is there another way? I've used chewy, PetSmart, and for heavens sake the vet's own contracted online pharmacy. I've called and emailed and left messages and talked to the front desk explaining that they NEED TO APPROVE THE REFILL REQUEST ASAP! What it comes down to is incompetence on the part of the front desk staff and probably an unmanageable caseload on the part of the vet. 

So.

Has anyone ever taken their cat's labs to the vet at, say, chewy or PetSmart, paid for the consult, and then just refilled he fluids through them that way? It seems like that should streamline the process and eliminate the need for so many different people in different organizations to coordinate their efforts.

Just got back from a vet appointment for my 2 year old, extremely anxious cat Millie. She's started overgrooming and her anxious behaviors have gotten worse. After I had to push for actual anxiety medication (the other interventions she suggested haven't worked), the Vet suggested fluoxetine tablets. I was unfamiliar with the medication and asked more about it. The vet briefly explained that it is a SSRI for cats. I explained that it is extremely hard to administer oral medication and asked if there is a topical option. She replied that no, she wasn't aware of anything like that. I asked her to clarify again, and she confirmed that she is unaware of any options that aren't oral. She prescribed the tablet form for me to order from their online pharmacy. 

When I got home, it took me one search on Chewy to find that there is definitely a non-oral option, and that it is Transdermal. I plan to call the office tomorrow during business  hours to explain the issues and get a transdermal prescription to send in to Chewy. 

  
What's up with this Vet? I'm concerned with her lack of knowledge. Is it because I said topical instead of transdermal? She should be able to use her inference skills for that one. Do some vets only prescribe what they offer from their online pharmacy? This was a Vet at Non-Profit, for reference. Any help is appreciated.

260,Chewy,chewy pharmacy,1jm0him,N/A,2025-03-28,"Chewy scripts: Will they approve incorrect spelling? After repeated attempts by our vet to slander Chewy and get us to purchase Rx flea preventative from their (more expensive) in-house pharmacy, and weeks of back & forth - we finally got them to give us a paper script to send to Chewy. Surprise! My name is spelled wrong. It's the same first name, just a different spelling (example: Stephen vs Steven). All other info is correct. Another fun surprise, vet is out of town for a week! I can't really wait another week+ for them to get this corrected script to me. 

I'm also afraid our vet, who didn't want us to go to Chewy in the first place, is going to be fed up with writing multiple scripts and give me a reason why they can't/won't. This will be the fourth one. When we first asked them to write us a physical script I asked specifically to have it put in my name, not my partner's name (who is the primary on our vet acct) as my name is the one on the Chewy account, so I needed it in my name to match Chewy. They wrote the script in partner's name anyway. I go to pick it up, ""hey actually I needed this in my name, as I stated initially"", ""ok no worries, we'll fix it and call you when it's ready!"". Next day I get a voicemail from the vet's office ""Hi I'm understanding you needed another script but I'm seeing here we already gave one to you? Please call us back to clarify"", then an hour later another voicemail ""Hi disregard last message, your script is ready!"" so I'm thinking okay they figured it out. Go to pick it up, AGAIN it's in my partner's name. I explain once again - this needs to be in my name, that's why I needed the FIRST one replaced. FINALLY I go today to pick it up and it's in my name but spelled incorrectly. And can't get a corrected one for at least a week. Every time I've picked up a new script I have exchanged it for the one they gave me prior, so I'm not just stacking prescriptions over here.

So I'm ready to just send it and take my chances. Anyone had experience with misspelled info on scripts to Chewy? I'm wondering if they'll be super strict about the spelling or if someone will have the common sense to understand it shouldn't be a huge deal as the address and all other info match.

1st post be gentle  

  

Chewy.com has a great deal going on right now and they all stack together

Our GSD loves frisbees and we go through them often. Heres an example of my order  

  

Quanity x 1 : Hyperflite K-10 HyperFlex Disc Dog Toy, Purple $19.60 each  

Quanity x 3 : Chuckit! Paraflight Dog Toy, Large $9.98 each  

  

Items (5): $49.54

35% Off First Autoship Order. (discount -$13.85)  

Will email you the free $20 E-Gift Card after your order ships (enter promo code #Welcome)  

Total Before Tax: $25.71  

  

Hopefully I can use that E-Gift card to create a new account with my wifes info and repeat the order only paying $5.71 + tax for the same items to have plenty of extra frisbees for currency. Will update this post when I know.  

  

Hope this helps someone. If so please share your deal. The only negative thing is the 3+1 deal only gives you the lowest price item for free. But if you buy 3 items for $10 and a 4th for $20 it will take $10 off that item. Play around with it you will find a great deal!!

Yes! They have little tummies. I'd get oats from the supermarket, not chewy. Just make sure they aren't the instant kind. 

>Apple sticks? Do yours just gnaw the outside and then they are done? Ghibli has like 5 apple sticks in his cage that he had hiding, lol.


Yep, I'm constantly trying to decide if they are done with a stick or there is enough bark to leave it in the cage. 
Whimsy's Menagerie has the best deal on sticks as they price per pound instead of per stick. Most of my toys came from there as well.  [Whimsy's](https://www.whimsysmenagerie.com/sticks-stones)

Oxbow is fine. I switched to small pet select recently. You can get both on Chewy. 


>2 of his ledges came with plastic food bowls. Those went to Goodwill immediately, but now his bowl doesn't fit. Is there a bowl someone can recomend or should I just sand the hole until it fits?

385,Chewy,chewy autoship,m6n7w0f,1hz4bow,2025-01-11,"You need an active client patient relationship in order to fill any meds. This means that the pet needs to have been seen by a DVM in the past year. If it has not been, we legally cannot fill medications. The number of mean Yelp reviews demonizing vets for “refusing to refill” meds is so incredibly frustrating as vet. I say this for the non-vet people browsing these threads that then read these reviews and think the vet is an a*hole. It seems like you still had the active client patient relationship. 

Personally at my clinic, we recommend thyroid testing every 6 months. If you were due for lab work, we’d refill enough to get you a couple days past the scheduled appointment that way if there is a dose change, we’re not wasting more medication and your money. However, we understand that this is a recommendation and not a requirement. It may not be financially possible for everyone or there may be other circumstances making difficult. If that’s the case, I refill it as long as we have done lab work/exam in the past year. If the client declines lab work yearly, I have them sign an against medical advice form and continue to refill. If they have not been in the past year, no refills and no exceptions.

Given Chewy was not due until end of January, they should have continued to refill ESPECIALLY if they cancelled your appointment. I’ll never be one to condemn a clinic because we are only hearing one side of the story but you should always always always be able to speak to the practice manager if you request. My practice manager would have absolutely waived the filling fee.

388,Chewy,chewy vet,mp3jfcj,1k82pp7,2025-04-26,"This is such an outdated myth that it’s honestly infuriating that so many vet med staff continue to use it as an excuse to refuse to work with online pharmacies. Like 10+ years ago there was concern that Chewy and 1-800-Pet-Meds were selling shady gray market stuff. That’s no longer the case. Chewy pharmacies are licensed and accredited. Some docs don’t like that they sell compounded prescription medications, but they use all FDA approved ingredients for compounded medications (the same as human pharmacies). Also, at Chewy you have the benefit of a licensed pharmacist reviewing your order at multiple different points, vs. most clinics where an assistant with sometimes only a few months of experience fills your order. 

The real issue here is that (a) clinics don’t like losing money to pharmacies like Chewy and (b) it creates  another task to approve orders through online pharmacies. In my experience, the clinics that embrace working with online pet pharmacies have a smooth experience; the ones who are reluctant or resentful tend to have issues because they don’t bother learning how it works.

AVMA ethics, and some state laws, require your veterinarian to provide a written script. You can fill it at a human pharmacy like Costco as others have mentioned, or you could mail it in to Chewy. Doing that every month would be a pain, but I believe you can mail multiple prescriptions at once. Also, your vet can write for a higher number of pills/tablets/mls and Chewy will keep that on record and allow you to order monthly or by whatever frequency works for you. If your vet refuses to do even that, you need to decide if you’re okay with that. It would personally be a dealbreaker for me as I order multiple medications every month for my dog, but if you’re willing to take the hit because you only need preventatives a couple times a year and really like your vet, that’s reasonable too.",comment,15,,,https://reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1k82pp7/vet_is_no_longer_filling_prescriptions_from_chewy/mp3jfcj/,Chewy

I have had vets set up barriers like that.  Several told me they won’t transfer the script over the phone, i have to come get the piece of paper and then send it to chewy myself.  (Delay! And they have to confirm by phone anyway!🙄)  I have a vet who will only use one on line pharmacy (not chewy) because she is a specialist with little office support and doesn’t want to be on the phone all day.  But the prices are reasonable.

400,Chewy,chewy vet,mmg5g39,1jw3d84,2025-04-10,"Have been a Chewy auto-delivery customer for nearly 9 years. The reason I order almost exclusively pouch food for my cats is due to frequent can damage caused by FedEx. I even had 2 of those 17-lb. plastic buckets of Tidy Cat litter pop @ the strap around the top in transit. Those straps require brute force to remove by hand, so I have no idea how FedEx got them to snap in transit, TWO separate times. The litter was all over the inside of my delivery box & spilled everywhere when I opened the carton. Dented cans were worrisome enough (as the seal may be broken, but not overtly visible) but when I found a burst can of food in one carton, that had rotted, stank, & seeped through the carton onto my wood floor, & found one of my cats licking @ the seepage, I was done. I  asked to cancel my account but the rep was masterful @ attempting to fix it. I also got the bright idea of switching to pouch food, but it IS more expensive. While it is not Chewy's fault, & they do indeed have a generous replacement policy, they continue to use FedEx as a carrier, as do most of the online pet supply vendors (so even if you switch vendors, they'll likely still be using FedEx). FedEx is guilty of numerous poor practices. I have lost count of the # of complaints Chewy has filed w/ FedEx on my behalf. Other than ordering smaller packages of 3-oz. canned food & other items, all I can suggest is ordering pouch food. Just be aware that many pouch foods are < 3 oz./pouch. I have not had any damaged pouches, & 24-packs, such as Merrick Backcountry (3 oz.), usually come in a sturdy cardboard carton taped shut. Some brands of pouch food in 12-packs, like Tiki Cat, come in thin, flimsy boxes that come open along their perforations, but individual pouches in these have not been damaged.",comment,6,,,https://reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1jw3d84/damaged_cans_from_chewy/mmg5g39/,Chewy

405,Chewy,chewy pharmacy,m8okcyl,1i7b7d1,2025-01-23,"This is my first time ever posting, apologies to the mods if I violated any rules.

I made a promise to my kitties that I would post all our tips and tricks on Reddit, and it feels intimidating because sometimes the comments are upsetting and well I’m a sensitive soul. 

Tanya’s guide as mentioned by others below was an invaluable resource. Our approach was very proactive and we were scared like you bc we couldn’t stop the vomiting or coax them to eat. It’s high maintenance, it’s expensive, but we got our cats back to stage 2 from stage 3, and neither progressed past stage 2. Lived another 5 years, age 19). 

They went from being chonks to slightly underweight and once we got a rhythm they went back to being slightly overweight and maintained with the regimen below. I want to be clear, I am not a vet and you should consult with yours before doing any of the following. FYI, we decided to spend the $$ to see a renal specialist who wasn’t really much help and most of the info was the same as what the primary vet told us. Just our experience. Here was our regimen below, I’m sure through trial and error, you and your kitty will find a rhythm too:

1. Mirataz as others mentioned as appetite stimulant, instructions show you how to rub it on the ear but I found it helpful to ask the vet to show me. Make sure you use gloves, or your appetite will increase too.
2. Get purina hydra care specifically. Mix it into every meal. Ours loved it, and if I had to pick one thing, this was what kept them so hydrated.
3. Get Costco size cans of tuna. Open a little to pour out only the broth. Pour a little over each meal. Put the rest in the fridge, it’s good for a day or two.

3a. Ask the vet if you can crush the medication. If so, use a pill crusher crush the pill and mix it with only tuna juice. The cat will lick it clean. And you can tell after whether any is remaining. Pour a lil more if she didn’t quite get it all. Also we tried  churru but it was hit or miss with ours. 

4. Try different renal moist/canned foods. There are some non-prescription, like Weruva has variety pack of low phos food. Ours ended up being only willing to eat royal canin e prescription. 

5. Phosphorous is the enemy. A phosbinder will help phosphorous pass thru kidneys. You can find them on Amazon, we used Rxbinder or something like that, a scoop with each meal (even if low phos diet esp if you have to use tuna juice to prompt eating like we did).

6. Since cats need to drink a lot of water, night time is usually the most risk for binge drinking and vomiting water bc they lose their appetite and need encouragement to eat. Right before you go to sleep, feed them the above meal of ingredients. This helped them stay hydrated while we slept.

6a. Keep treats out of reach but right next to your bed nightstand, esp if she’s smart and motivated to rip into those. If you feel like they were light on food for the day, give them treats right before bed. Ours went nuts for greenies - dental and smarties greenies. 

6b. Feed them a few treats right when you wake up wake up. That way you don’t have to rush to get her the meal because it’ll get sustenance in her tummy before they inevitably inhale water as you try to get ready for the day. The goal is a steady streak of moist nutrients throughout the day- 4x/day if possible.

6c. She may also eat only a little at first and then walk away. Just follow her to the next spot she sits and place it in front of her again. And one more time. She just needs encouragement and they get fatigued eating, so promoting like this helps. Pour a lil of that tuna juice if she’s still not eating.
6d. If you can catch her while she is napping, hold the bowl under her nose to sniff - cats natural instinct is to start eating as they wake. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t.

7. Get a water fountain. The sound of the water encourages them to drink. 

7a. Weird as this sounds, our kitties were drawn to the water more when we placed an avocado seed (rinsed of all soft green) in them. If you have dogs, they are not safe for dogs to eat. 

8. We found all prescriptions cheapest and quickest from chewy. Several vets wanted it to go through one in NJ, but they were 3x more expensive than chewy and took longer.

9. The urine will smell. We found our cats preferred crystal litter. We found this litter absorbed the smell the most, and our kitties would continue to use it. Scoop it everyday, and use a hypoallergenic cleaner to wipe down the sides esp if yours is a sprayer. Be careful of the litters with a lot of dust.

10. Also, our cats were more likely to eat with the ergonomic bowls, where the bowls sit up higher, not on the ground. 

11. The vet showed us one way to tell how hydrated or dehydrated our cats were. Grab/pull the excess skin on their back up a little and see if the fur stays up or reshapes quickly. If the fur takes its time to fall, it’s an informal clue your cats hydration might be low.  

12. Get copies of your cats vet records and place a copy in an outside pocket on the pet carrier, get the kidney values(not just the stage) and history. That way if for any reason you need to take her to the emergency room, you can hand it right over.

That’s all I can remember right now, but I’ll edit if we think of anything else. Hope this helps. The hardest part is breaking the cycle of vomiting water and not eating. The above was all through trial and error over the course of years, I can’t promise you it will work for your fur baby but it did for ours. If she doesn’t have complications and you’re able to get it under control, she can live for quite a few years with this condition. It is a lot of maintenance. Yes, I’m aware I spoiled the sh** out of our cats, oy it hit the budget hard with the amount of $$ we spent, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Any entity that doesn’t require a prescription for something that typically requires a prescription should be a HUGE red flag. 
And even Chewy ended up selling a batch of counterfeit Bravecto a couple of years ago and it wasn’t discovered until some dogs got sick. 
The issue with any of these online (and this includes places like Chewy) entities is they are what is called in the industry as “third party sellers”. 
This means that if your dog gets sick or the product doesn’t work correctly, you are shit out of luck. The manufacturer does not guarantee health or safety of the product or its efficacy. 
However, when you buy your product directly from your veterinarian, the product does have the full guarantee from the manufacturer. 
Take Heartgard for example, and I will try to shorten the story but can give more details if needed: we had a client (only been seen by us once when the client moved up here) come in and their dog became heartworm positive. Dog has supposedly been on Heartgard year round since a puppy (dog is close to 2yrs now). In theory, the manufacturer would have refunded the owner their entire script (previous vet had given the owners a one year script in paper form) and paid for the entire treatment for the heart worm itself. But, the owner obtained the product from an online vendor. Doing this nullified any guarantee from the manufacturer. And legally, these online vendors don’t have to disclose any manufacturer nullifications to owners. 
If you see some of the places where and how these medications are stored at the warehouses of some of these online places, you would understand. Some medications really do need to be kept within a certain temperature range. When you are storing product in a traditional non temperature controlled warehouse, up in overstock, high in the air where the temps can get to 80+ degrees and then some during the summer, these products can lose their efficacy.",comment,2,,,https://reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1ipzvle/purchasing_flea_tick_medication_from_online/mcw6yjx/,Chewy

441,Petsmart,Petsmart,1dzko6l,N/A,2024-07-09,"I have a 22 lb 4 month old staffy / XL bully mix. I took her to petsmart today for her first puppy training lesson at Petsmart and.. I had a bad experience with the trainer. I’m considering calling the store manager and getting a refund and not showing up for the next 5 lessons. Basically I was referred to her for training by my coworker from my dog groomers job who has 2 pitbulls, so I thought to myself my puppy would be in good hands- free of the high bully breed discrimination that’s heavy in our town… but that wasn’t exactly the case. I had many owners in the class look at her and pull away their golden doodles, dachsunds, golden retrievers, aussies, Great Dane, etc. Some of these dogs were bigger and older than her mind you. The trainer seemed very scattered in her direction, giving each of the dogs a toy so she could distract them and talk to all the owners about things like peanut butter in Kong toys, potty training and crate training. While that was going on some dogs were trying to steal other dogs toys, some showing aggressive resource guarding signs, and people treating their dogs left and right. One dog ( a dachsund) got attacked by a golden retriever puppy because the trainer allowed the owners to let it off leash since she was “shy and needed to meet other dogs.” Once it got attacked the owner of the dachsund got very upset and almost left and the trainer laughed it off and checked the dog and said it was fine, and the aggressor was just trying to play. I think the opposite, as it was showing teeth growling and lunging crazily plus it was 7 months old which is definitely not too early to show aggression. I was thinking to myself “thank god it wasn’t my dog who attacked, she’s the only bully in this whole group” and I was aware how bad it could’ve looked. I’ve had my puppy socialized heavily outside of this, from the dog beach, to my friend’s dogs, to the vet and walks in public places, to even letting her observe and socialize with other clients at my groomer’s job. I admit she can get a little over excited as any puppy can, and I’ve been working on correcting her with that. I watch plenty of dog training videos on how to do this. She overwhelms my older dog a lot and I moderate their playing every time. But today at the lesson, I guess she became a little too much for this jack russel mix and it growled and lunged at her. My puppy growled/lunged back as I’ve never seen her do before. Then the golden retriever puppy I mentioned earlier came over pulling and lunging too. The golden retriever owner apologized as she was still embarassed from the previous altercation with the dachsund, and the trainers response was “It’s okay I’m not worried about him”. Then she turned around to point at my dog , and goes “her 👆I’m a little concerned about”. And everyone just stared and I felt like I wanted to cry. For the rest of the lesson I held my puppy’s attention well with the next few commands, and I would say better than some of the other owners did. She was focused and behaved and followed every command. At the end of the class,  the trainer said to let every dog off leash to play. I did not at first because I felt if she’s so concerned about MY dog like she told the class I shouldn’t. But she yelled at me saying “I said let her off leash”. And everyone kind of stared nervously as I did. But she was fine, playing normally like the rest of them. Once again, that troublesome golden retriever came by to play and growled at her .. my puppy growled back. I pulled her away in case. All the owners started grabbing their dogs away from my dog and one even went up to me and asked “what is her breed?” I replied “staffy” and she goes “what is staffy” and i explained “staffordshire bull terrier” and she just made a fake smile. Let’s just say I came to the lesson very excited and hopeful, to feeling very outcasted and afraid of what’s to come. Can anyone offer any advice? Should I train her somewhere else for group classes? 1 on 1 instead? Should I file a complaint with the store and ask for a refund? Should I just socialize her more as much as I can (even though I feel like I have) and just try to push through the next 5 weeks? I’m also afraid she’ll get bigger and scarier to people and her personality can get affected by their energy. I’m lost. ",post,1269,0.99,179,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dzko6l,Petsmart

444,Petsmart,Petsmart,1ihmof0,N/A,2025-02-04,"Petsmart let my puppy fall from a top kennel on his head and didn't tell me I am so angry at Petsmart.

I took my 16 week old shih tzu puppy to Petsmart for a bath service. We went to lunch next door and waited for him to be done so he wouldn't be kenneled long.

We were there to pick him up within about 10 minutes of the call that he was done. They handed him to me, he looked dapper, everything was good.

When we loaded him into his car seat, he started to yelp this HORRIBLE yelp I've never heard from him before. It was gasping, shrill and hoarse. A horrible noise. We got him home and let him settle.

We noticed he yelping when he walked but didn't react when we checked his paws or legs. He had feeling but they weren't hurting.

I called Petsmart and it took two people before someone would finally admit that they put him in a top kennel and it didn't fully latch, so he fell onto the ground. They let him walk around a little, thought he was fine, and handed him to me without informing me that my dog could have experienced a head trauma.

Cool.

So, 5 hours at the veterinary ER later, we were able to get x-rays and he *appears* OK but they don't know for sure. His growth plates are still open and neck x-rays aren't 100% reliable. But nothing concerning appeared. He seems neurologically sound. It ended up being a soft tissue injury to his neck and shoulder.

He's on pain medicine right now and seems to be improving. He's acting more like himself now, two days later.

Petsmart did pay for the vet bills. But the absolute NEGLIGENCE to not check if a top crate was latched and to assume you can just brush off a potential head injury infuriates me.

I got my training refunded. I am never going back to that store.

But I have to ask... how do I get a puppy on pain meds to settle the eff down? His pain happens when he moves his head, so playing is difficult without risk of reinjury. The gabapentin only keeps him down for so long.",post,3197,0.99,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1ihmof0/petsmart_let_my_puppy_fall_from_a_top_kennel_on/,Petsmart

456,Petsmart,Petsmart,1i4igzn,N/A,2025-01-18,"After years of reading posts like this, I'm now writing one. My beloved soul cat, Tang, 14, crossed the rainbow bridge. Please witness him I posted Tang here a few times. Unfortunately, cancer and heart failure demanded the ultimate duty a cat parent must see through. Tang passed peacefully today at home, where he spent most of his life. My wife and I were by his side. Tang was my first ever cat, and as the oldest, the first death I have experienced. Today has been the hardest day of my life.

Tang was originally adopted by my brother and his new wife. They chose Tang from the other cats at Petsmart because he happened to have their wedding date listed as his date of birth. They saw it as a sign. If it really was a sign, it was a bad one, as my brother divorced barely a year later LOL. He had to move to a new apartment, one that didn't take cats. He asked if I could take Tang just for a little while until he could find a new place. I was hesitant, as I was a single guy in my early 20s. But I agreed.

Tang's journey to my house is a story that gets retold all the time, with great laughter. But if I'm being honest, the memory makes me cringe. I still feel bad, all these years later. My brother said Tang hates car rides and would cry the entire 2 hour drive back to my place. He suggested I should put his carrier in the trunk of my little Honda Civic so I wouldn't be bothered with the crying for 2 hours. At this point, I should mention that this was in the height of summer...but I was young and dumb and didn't know any better.

As I start driving, I could hear Tang crying from the trunk. There was almost no soundproofing. Putting him in the trunk was pointless. But after about 5 minutes, he stopped. I thought, cool, maybe the solitude of the trunk calmed him down. I drove the 2 hours to my house. When I opened the trunk and looked into the carrier, Tang looked like he had a bucket of water dumped over him. He was panting like crazy. I rushed him into the house, toweled him off, and gave him water.

For the next 3 weeks, Tang hid under the couch I had in the formal living room. One night, as I sat on the couch in the main living room, watching TV, Tang came slowly into the room and then jumped on the couch and settled into my lap. And just like that, I had a constant companion for the next 13 years. He was the opposite of most cats' reputation. He was never aloof, but clingey. He never had zoomies or really played at all. He just liked to sleep, eat, cuddle with me all night, and eat some more. He had the best life.

When my wife came into the picture, he included her in his cuddles. He loved to literally lay on top of her head at night. She loved him as much as I did. I wish I could have had several more years with him. But I'm infinitely glad of the years I got.

Tang, we love you and will miss you for all our lives. We are so grateful we got to be your humans. I hope you are already running around and eating as much tuna as you want. We will see you again. Wait for us.",post,10851,0.98,585,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4igzn,Petsmart

I’m Arlen Addison (she/her), dog trainer in Houston, Tx. For the past 13 months, there’s been an ongoing national effort to unionize Petsmarts across America. We’re working with United Food & Commercial Workers (UFCW); one of the largest unions in the US, with over 1+ million members.

I have to drop my 4 foster kittens, plus mom, off today to Petsmart, where they will stay for the next two weeks. This little family is now fully fixed and vaccinated, and are all thriving. They are very tightly bonded (always together), and loving spending time outdoors. Anyway, my rescue is having me turn them over to Petsmart for their adoption event for the next two weeks, and I feel terrible that I’m about to move them from this wonderful open environment that they seem to love, to a closed-off, tiny, and stressful space. Not to mention the potential for splitting them up into homes as only-cats (when they are clearly very pack-oriented). I’m almost hoping they don’t get adopted so that I can bring them all back to live with me. I don’t know what my rescue’s policy is as far as requiring adoption in pairs, but I plan to let them know that I’m willing to keep the kittens as long as necessary to ensure they get adopted with a sibling, or at the very least a home with another cat. Just looking for advice, encouragement, personal stories, etc. Thanks! 

EDIT: Thank you all for the wonderful comments. Unfortunately the man who runs the rescue today text me that they are having a hard time and one of the girls is really acting out. OF COURSE SHE IS!

473,Petsmart,Petsmart,1k08qhz,N/A,2025-04-15,"Thinking of trying to rescue this ball from petsmart but I’m terrified of snakes So basically my whole life I’ve been afraid of snakes and just always found them creepy. Over the last several months I’ve found myself fascinated by ball pythons and gone down a rabbit hole of watching YouTube videos about caring for ball pythons and reading posts on this sub. I’ve grown to appreciate their beauty and have started to find ball pythons specifically very fascinating. Still wasn’t sure if I would ever want to own one or not. I can’t see myself ever wanting any other type of snake. 

Lately I have been taking my dog that I recently rescued to petsmart. It works out really nice where I live there is a Home Depot right next door to the petsmart so I can walk around the garden center with my dog and shop for plants and then take him to get a new bone or something at petsmart after. 

I’ve had this dog for about 3 months now so for atleast 3 months I’ve seen this same exact ball python sitting in this tank that seems way too small and dirty. Today I asked one of the employees if they knew anything about this python like just age or sex. The employees started radioing around the store asking if anyone knew its age or sex and nobody knew. 

So look all I know about taking care of snakes is what I’ve watched on YouTube, but how can a store properly take care of a snake if they don’t even know how old or what sex it is? 

Every time I go in there it’s just sitting curled up in its ball. Today was the first time I ever saw it moving around and I don’t know much about snake behavior but it looked like the snake was trying to stretch out. I do know enough about taking care of snakes to know that tank is not big enough for the snake to fully stretch out in and that’s not good. 

To be honest I’m not even sure if I have the ability to take better care of the snake that petsmart does but I kind of want to try. 

If money wasn’t so tight I probably would’ve just bought a whole tank and setup tonight and took the snake home with me. Like I’m not broke but I really don’t have a ton of disposable income. 

I don’t know I guess I made this post to see what actual snake keepers think. I think the snake caught me staring at it tonight when I saw it moving around and he came to the glass and we were like staring eachother in the eyes it was really cool. I guess he/she was on my mind on my way home so I thought I would ask Reddit what I should do",post,82,0.79,87,https://i.redd.it/17dji2lio3ve1.jpeg,Petsmart

479,Petsmart,Petsmart,1k5n082,N/A,2025-04-22,"Are all salons like this, or would it be worth applying to PetsMart or Petco? My salon has dedicated bathers, so the only thing groomers do is clip and scissor dogs. We’re *supposed* to not have to wash, dry, or brush any dogs, although very very often (like every dog) the bathers just don’t brush the dogs or dry them fully so I have to do that myself. 
I work 9-5, and in those eight hours I’m scheduled with an average of 10 dogs, sometimes up to 16 dogs with most of them being full shaves, and a couple trims (such as goldens or aussies or poms) 
We’re expected to do large dogs, such as bernadoodles or standard poodles, shave downs in an hour, and small dogs, such as malteses or cavapoos, shave down in 30 minutes. 
Is this a normal expectation? I always feel rushed and i feel like my grooms turn out sloppy because of it. I ask for advice from the higher ups on how to improve my groom quality, but all I get are tips on how to be faster. 
It takes me 45 minutes to an hour on small dogs and an hour to an hour and a half for big dogs, but I recognize that I’m still starting out and dont have my speed down as much as my coworkers who have been grooming for 6 months to a couple years have. But I stay an hour and a half late almost every day to catch up, and because I’ll have to spend an extra 15 or so minutes on every dog I get brushing out any tangles or mats in their ears and tail or coat if they’re getting a guard comb since the bathers aren’t doing all that they should. 


Some background: I’ve been doing haircuts at a corporate salon for a month now. I worked here as a bather since January, and I went to grooming school back in September, but this is my first actual grooming job. I’m very much a baby groomer. 
My salon is one of those places that only does “puppy cuts”; same length all over body and a round head. Sometimes we’ll take a client wanting a standard cut, but that’s very rare and we’re not supposed to do it. I’m often the one who ends up doing the standard cuts at this point though because I’m the only groomer who still works there that knows how to do them besides the manager. 
I went with this place because not a lot of salons in the area are hiring baby groomers besides petsmart, and everyone I work with says petsmart is awful; and because I’m not very confident in my skills so I thought this would be a good place to learn more. But I don’t feel like I’m learning anything anymore. I feel like my quality has gotten worse just because everything is so rushed. 

I’m not totally miserable here, I love my coworkers so much and I love the dogs I get to work with. So if it’s a common thing I can totally suck it up and focus on my speed. 

I attached some pics of my grooms from this week and last! They’re kinda messy and I so wish I was able to clear up all the sticky outies and flyaways 😖 ",post,138,0.99,64,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5n082,Petsmart

487,Petsmart,Petsmart,1kqqn2y,N/A,2025-05-19,"New at PetSmart & Dealing with My First Rude Customer – Advice? Hey everyone! I’ve been working at PetSmart for about a week now, and honestly, I really like it so far. I love being around animals all day (except bird deep clean day). It’s definitely a good fit for me. My only real complaint is the occasional rude customer.

The other day, I was put on register by myself for the first time. I was actually excited because I’d picked it up pretty quickly, and it seemed straightforward…until this past weekend.

I was checking out an older woman, probably in her late 60s. I greeted her, and I even remember thinking, “Wow, I really like her purse.” She put six cans of dog food on the counter and mentioned that there was a “buy five, get the sixth free” promotion. I assumed the system would automatically apply the deal, like it does at most retail stores, but I didn’t realize I had to manually enter it.

I called my manager over on the earpiece, and while I waited (maybe 30 seconds), the woman started huffing and crossing her arms. I started to feel nervous, thinking, “Oh no, I better hurry.” My manager came over and quickly showed me how to apply the discount—great! I explained what happened to the customer, but she didn’t respond.

She had a credit card in her hand, so I hit the credit option on the register (mainly trying to hurry). But when I turned back around, she was holding $60 in cash. So I had to backtrack and cancel the card transaction. That meant hitting the “X” on the donation screen to reset the process.

That’s when she snapped.

She asked, “When can I make my donation?” I calmly explained that it was my mistake, and to allow her to donate, I’d have to void the entire transaction and start over. She immediately began yelling at me, saying, “That’s the whole reason I bought this discounted food—to donate my $2! You people are so stupid. You can’t do anything right!”

I was shocked. I tried to stay calm and finish the transaction, but she kept yelling, even accusing me of not giving her change correctly: “You give the coins first! Unbelievable!” At that point, people were staring, and my manager, who had been at the other register, saw the whole thing. She told me I could take a quick break.

I went to the bathroom and cried. It was my first experience with someone like that, and it really shook me. I think what hurt the most was that I was genuinely trying—smiling, moving quickly, explaining things kindly—but none of it seemed to matter. I even told her I was new, but she didn’t care.

So, my question is:

490,Petsmart,Petsmart,1kta99p,N/A,2025-05-22,"After 22 different fully charted cat litter tests… I have finally found the holy grail And before some moron says “oh he’s a troll or he’s with one of the companies” I’m not and if you wish to think that, knock yourself out, I have no desire to convince you otherwise so feel free to ignore what I’m sharing then.

However, for those who care about what the holy grail of litter means to me, it is as follows, which I share purely out of the nice guy in me, because I would want someone to share this with me.

So I just purchased 13 different types of litter and literally created an excel sheet and monitored tracking, smell, cleanliness inside the snowy, duration and how fast for the bin to get full.

I have finally come up with the perfect combination of litters.  It isn’t cheap but it isn’t terrible, it is about 1.5-1.7 times the cost of Arm & Hammer Slide and those premium clay litters.

So this combination I settled on gave me:
- zero tracking
- zero smell
- lasted the longest among the 22 different combinations I tried

It should be noted I have two cats, one of which is unstable diabetic so pees excessively

If you have just one cat and/or none of your cats are diabetic, your results will be even better than mine so lucky you.

I have the Pet Snowy litter box, and I use Glad Cherry Blossom garbage bags, and I use the third party pet snowy bag clips you can buy on Etsy, so you don’t have to pay for the expensive pet snowy bags.

For additional smell control, I use a healthy sprinkle of:

https://a.co/d/9XH9qhL
and
https://a.co/d/aLJeFU9

I put a healthy sprinkle in with the litter and also a healthy sprinkle in the empty bag in the bin.

The litter combination I use is as follows:

3 Cups of the multigrain Sustainably Yours
https://www.petsmart.ca/5308031.html

4 Cups of CatIt Pea Husk Litter
https://a.co/d/e7vh7UP

2cups PetSafe unscented litter crystals
https://a.co/d/hpge2KE


This lasted my two cats, one with very excessive urinating, 2.5 days between changes, zero tracking, zero smell, no scooping.  It would at least 3.5 days if my cat was urinating normally, probably even 4 days.

So this is, to me, the perfect combination.  The only drawback is the cost being about 1.5-1.75 times the cost of Arm&Hammer Slide but the trade off is worth it.

There is no other drawback to this combination.  I have tested it thoroughly, tried every litter out there, and charted it all.  I put my personal word behind this combination and that might not mean anything since you don’t know me, but I would be VERY surprised if someone tried this as I’ve outlined and didn’t also have the exact same conclusion as me.

Let me know if you try it!

Also, the reason I did this is because we live in a very small condo and my partner hates cats to no end.  He is very patient otherwise but I have to make sure the cats are as minimal of impact as possible otherwise we fight about it so I’ve just learned to keep on top of it.  But that doesn’t mean I want to be doing cat chores all day so I wanted to find the best combination, for as little work as possible.

We have a robot vacuum that is programmed to vacuum around the litter box every time a cat is finished going to the washroom, the motion sensor inside tells the vacuum to go to that area and vacuum.

So this is one step to make my life easier :)",post,1254,0.97,551,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1kta99p/after_22_different_fully_charted_cat_litter_tests/,Petsmart

495,Petsmart,Petsmart,1ia0dxe,N/A,2025-01-25,"Bob, the Hawaii cat Two years ago my husband and I went to Hawaii to get married. One night, we saw a bunch of people in the bushes outside the hotel trying to help catch a kitten. No one was successful, but I bought food and left it out. I let the hotel know, but nothing came of it. 

The next night, the poor guy was screaming again. I bought more food, and spent an hour standing frozen over the food until I could snag this little one. 

The original plan was to get him to a shelter. I got him checked out by a vet, and was warned that no one would take him. Shelters were full, and since he was a black cat it would be even harder. When we went to PetSmart we saw every single cat there was a void looking for a home. My husband said he was ours now. 

We originally named him after the hotel, but as you can see with his half a tail, he is clearly a Bobcat. We spent the next two weeks in Hawaii doing tourist things, and since we couldn’t leave him in the hotel, Bob joined us. We climbed a mountain with this cat. He was our ringbearer. He went to a luau. 

I panicked trying to figure out how we would get him home. Spent thousands changing our flight (our airport didn’t allow animals to fly in, so we had to go somewhere else) and paying fees to take an animal on board. 

It was a crazy experience. It was worth the stress and every penny. I love my Bob. ",post,9162,0.99,157,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ia0dxe,Petsmart

I have another older dog that I have taught very basic “tricks” to over a year and a half. But since this is a puppy and was adopted with the intent to train, I did it.

I have talked to countless employees who share my disgust and genuinely feel stuck and powerless to their corporate bosses who care more about profit over practice. I have seen other fish stores across the globe adopt more ethical and practical ways of selling and housing these fish in store and I am working on presenting my findings with advice to the higher ups in my local branches and farther up the corporate ladder. 

I have gotten contact information from local employees as well as done some of my own research to find ways of contacting the “big wigs” at the corporate offices. I have had success contacting larger corporations (Lowe’s, Turo, DoorDash etc.) before when I have had issues in the past with their practices etc. and am hoping that something might be able to come from this with enough evidence and advice. 


If anyone else on here wants to join me, has their own evidence or advice- maybe even anonymous employees who would like to air their grievances or a lawyer or two who would like to chime in, I would so appreciate it. I know this is a long shot and I’m not the first or last person to try and get these large chain stores to change their ways but it is worth a shot.

I started to wear a certain bracelet to work in the grooming salon along with another co-worker. I was told originally that I had to take it off. Then it was ""take it off or flip it insideout for now till we hear back from HR"". Then it was ""we can't tell you to take it off"" then came the new re written policy. Now it's again it has to come off because it's ""political"". All the while it has not come off my wrist. 

I want to know if anything is happening In other stores along these lines and how it's being handled. 

The bracelet says ""Save Gaza Free Palestine""

The reason it started is because of one complaint from a man who does not shop at our store or use our services. He came in to look at the cats one day and saw the coworker on the way to the bathroom. There has not been a single complaint again since this has started. 

The coworker who wears it as well is half Jewish. We have people from all walks of life who respect each other's beliefs and opinions even when they don't align with eachother. This includes a coworker who moved here from Palestine a year ago and wears a hajab. 

I have asked what about this support bracelet makes it political. What would happen if I wore a pro choice bracelet, a pride bracelet, etc. 

They brought up our safety, saying other stores have had employees be attacked recently. When asked if it had anything to do with what's going on, the answer was no. My logic is if someone is going to do something, they are going to do it regardless. My bracelet has not been an instigation for anyone so far and to say you want to protect us is a bold claim seeing as how us women in the salon department are constantly harassed by people on the daily. Angry customers, creepy situations and even stalking.. we already need the protection we aren't getting. 

I'm here to hear from other petsmart associates. 

It may just seem like a silly bracelet to some people and not worth losing my job over but for the many people who have been effected by this in one way or another it's means something very real. 

I'm at a point I may be fired over this and in my opinion it would be unjustified.

Yes the fish will have a better life with you, but you're still part of the overall problem. Clearly big name stores are making a profit selling fish or they would stop. (Ideally legislature on fish abuse would be nice...)

Now I get to work on getting him medication. My dog was diagnosed with a grade 2 heart murmur 8 months ago. I was told that he wasn't at the point that he needed medicine, but we just had to monitor him one to two times a year. At his annual appointment, the vet told me that ""he had the same issues with no real progression."" This was last week. 

Yesterday, I took my dog into a Petsmart for a standard grooming package--bath, nail trim, sanitary trim, and gland expression. They called the vet to verify his heart murmur grade--and it was grade 4! They said they couldn't see him, and advised me to take him to a vet groomer instead. Obviously, I was caught off guard and devastated. I had no idea his condition was that bad.

I am already incredibly poor and can't afford this, but I was able to call my family. They will give me some financial support to seek a second opinion and get a heart ultrasound so we can put my boy on medication. I am furious that my vet was dishonest with me, but I am so grateful to Petsmart's diligence. Because of YOU, my boy could get a few extra months or years added to his life--time in which he will have more energy and be in less pain.

511,Petsmart,Petsmart,1h7kg5p,N/A,2024-12-05,"Dog died at PetSmart groomer My 13yr old male GSD passed away at a PetSmart groomer. He had dog lupus that was under control and hardly affecting him aside from small scabbing on his nose. He also had arthritis and hip dysplasia but still sprinted outside to chase squirrels.

I took him to the groomer at 1PM and he passed around 4, 4:30PM. I got a call from the manager saying to come immediately. The PetSmart has a vet attached and I got put into a room. They took me to the vet lab and showed me that my dog had passed away. The story is, he was put into a kennel after he was done with his bath to take a break. Shortly after, they noticed he had peed himself and was on his side unresponsive. The vet doctor took his pulse and noticed it was extremely faint. I noticed they had shaved his fur and gave him a shot but I don't know what it was. The vet tried to revive him but his heart stopped.

I got a call from a pet advocate for PetSmart. Apparently it's an outside company that partners with PetSmart. They did an investigation and here's what the lady said:

""I spoke with PetSmart corporate regarding the review. Based on the review findings, Jax appeared a little nervous during check-in but didn’t show any signs of stress. You informed an associate at check-in that Jax had hip issues, so when an associate did Jax’s nails after check-in, they had another associate help them hold and support Jax while trimming his nails. The associate explained that he had no problems standing and showed no signs of stress, and she said he was “perfect.”

 

After his nails were done, an associate bathed Jax, and he had fleas, so he was given a flea bath. He stood throughout the bath without issue. The associate explained that Jax was alert, and he wagged his tail, barked, and was giving kisses. He didn’t appear stressed during this portion of the service, either.

 

After the bath, the associate dried Jax and put him in a kennel for a break. During this time, Jax was observed to be able to stand without any issues, and he appeared alert and calm. An associate observed that Jax was loving and playful with the groomer prior to and during the bath.

 

While Jax was in the kennel after his bath, an associate was cleaning a kennel nearby and noticed Jax was lying on his side, and the way he was laying was concerning to the associate, so they tried getting Jax’s attention, opening the door, and touching him, but he didn’t respond. The associate got help carrying him to the vet.""

I understand my dog is old and things like this can happen. Maybe he got too stressed. Idk. The thing is, I don't fully trust what someone says unless I see it with my own eyes or some police officer tells me. What do you guys think? Should I get a police report to review video footage?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the kind and supportive words, really helped with processing what I should do next. The PetSmart manager and employees seemed very genuine and I didn't feel any ill will. I think I'll leave this alone and accept that it was his time. On the outside, he was still playful and upbeat. I'm sure on the inside, his body was ravaged.

EDIT 2: PetSmart manager let me see the video. The groomers were very loving and careful with my old man. They were giving him treats and playing during the bath. After his bath, he was put in a kennel for around an hour. They checked on him at the 30 minute mark. At 50 minutes, a groomer noticed he was on his side and unresponsive. The entire grooming staff rushed to the kennel, pull him out, he stood up and looked around, but then started collapsing. They picked him up and ran him to the attached vet. When he got to the vet, his heart had stopped and he passed. The vet tried to inject him with something to start up his heart (or something like that). Honestly, I didn't think that the groomers mistreated him in any way. I just wanted to see his last moments.

all that being said; why is this something so common amongst big box pet stores? why are they allowed to openly abuse animals? at my store location specifically, i was interacting with an employee who was told, presumably by their manager, that the betta cups needed water changes. she responded by saying that’s why the lights are off on their display. so, it’s pretty blatant in my store that they do not care about the well-being of their animals and are more than willing to turn a blind eye to their needs. is this common? is it the employees or the companies themselves? i’d like to just open the discussion for this because it’s so important and seems to touch many of us in this community, rightfully so.

I fear the first issue was directly my fault. In my panic after seeing him move I picked him up by the tail (something I never do with living fish that jump out), I had a hard time believing he might actually be alive even after the movement. I think this is why the outer part of his tail gradually flaked off in the first day :( 

He also just seems… discolored. At this point I don’t think there’s much else I can do for him in our iso tank considering I’m the only one that even maintains it atm (something I even got in trouble for doing) and the tank keeps releasing years of dust built up around the lid and filter.

If you don’t want to pay for a vet visit that’s fine, but expecting a barely above minimum wage grocery store employee to be much help is wild. A customer had a question about health issues as a result of changing her small animals diet. When I didn’t know and asked over the walkie if anyone else was familiar the manager suggested google. I relayed the info and the customer said don’t you have to know about animals to work here? Like actually literally no. You just have to have a pulse to work here. In fact it would be safe to assume anyone educated enough to ethically answer this is almost certainly not here because they’re getting more appropriately compensated for their knowledge elsewhere. But now that you’re escalated in this situation I will refer you to my manager because while she just started here last week and admitted to not knowing about animals, she did come from clothing retail and is more qualified to deescalate you. 

On another note, if you want to buy a pet and need an employee to hold your hand through picking out food and habitats because you haven’t put in 15 minutes of research to know what it needs, you really don’t need to be owning a pet. 

To conclude, we probably don’t know more than google or your vet and if we did we wouldn’t be here.

I will always be thankful to petsmart for the experience they offered me, but if you're grooming there for a long time, and you're not seeking classes or learning potential outside of petsmart, you will become trapped and stagnant. There are so many groomers ive met at petsmart who were too comfortable and afraid to leave. I don't know what it is about the company , but they make you feel like you can't operate or groom anywhere else or as if your work and quality isn't good enough. To those that  are considering leaving petsmart grooming but you're scared not thinking you're not good enough. Trust me, you are good enough. Take the leap. Private shops are by far more less stressful. I ended up getting a job at a doggy daycare as a groomer. The dogs are so happy, they get to run around after they're groomed, I don't have to worry about phones ringing or customers gawking at me or bitching at me. Or busting in the salon while I have a challenging dog on the table, just to interrupt me to ask me about my car warranty or what flea collars on the floor I recommend.

537,Petsmart,Petsmart,1jtzinb,N/A,2025-04-07,"Groomer at Petsmart? You probably already know that at the end of April commissions will be changing. Bathing and walk in services will change from 50% to 35%, haircuts remain at 50%. 

 While Petsmart will definitely be taking 15% from select services, there is a voluntary offer of an additional 5% with haircut services. To earn 55% for your haircuts, there is a weekly requirement of averaging 6 dogs per day. This does not take into consideration the size, breed, time, conditions of the dog or their grooming services. That’s not really a fair chance for everyone, especially if you continually work with a lot of large dogs.

My store is usually action packed and groomers will help bathers do walk in services daily. This takes little to no product and is purely run on time and skill.
Some things including touch up packages, cannot be pushed onto the bathers.
I work at a store where stylists must frequently do face trims, nail trim & grinds, gland expressions, Etc.
We are expected to make time for these walk-in services regardless of how busy we are with our grooming appointments. Every dog has their own behaviour, giving no set time to complete a service. The demand can be very difficult and stressful. 

In my decade long Petsmart grooming salon experience, our services are hardly playing with puppies all day. As a senior stylist we are constantly helping in a struggle or taking over for newer employees that just aren’t experienced enough. How am I about to have commission taken away after all of these years of dedicated work? 

A common reason many groomers continue with a basic bath or nail trim client is for behaviour, it’s me they trust. Thinking of all the difficult and rewarding times, there’s so much skill that goes into every service that we do. Our salon is incredibly disheartened by the news. Anyone else?

I have made it very clear to my store manager that I would prefer to do MAX 2 large dogs a day. Reason being that I would like to extend the life of my wrists/back/knees as long as possible and be able to work on large dogs for a long time period. I really don’t want to go on a weight limit due to injury. 

I usually do 5-6 dogs a day (max 2 large) and the rest small ideally. However I was booked 4 large dogs yesterday so I blocked off my last two spots because (1) 4 large dogs in one day is exhausting and (2) I’m not fast enough to do more than that as a large dog usually takes me just under 2 hours. (3) the whole salon has been written up because we never take our lunches (no time due to overbooking) so I wanted to be able to take one. 

Well my store leader comes in and asks why I have blocks on so I explained to him why and he said I’m not allowed more than 1 block without a good reason (ex. Express service, etc..) and I should be able to do my 5-6 dogs per day even if they are all large. 

I was pretty angry after he left and am considering a weight limit at this point because then I can do the 6 dogs a day every day no problem and can get management off my back. I also think they don’t give a crap if I get injured doing so many large dogs and that pisses me off even more.

If you decide to try again I would find an independent reptile store or a breeder.  They send reptiles to UPS hubs and you pick up on site.  I’ve never had an animal arrive sick or injured using this method. 
You will quickly need a larger enclosure and a tube UVB lighting kit.  Whatever Petsmart told you to buy, it’s probably not correct.

Literally anyone can decide they’re a dog groomer and open their own shop (or get hired somewhere, some employers don’t care at all or consider it skilled work). Petsmart specifically is always burning through people as fast as they can train them. Anyone with any skill won’t be there for long - the level of their training also hugely varies and it’s super difficult to get someone fired, even if there’s video proof of them constantly mishandling dogs or being unsafe. They also have to do about a dog per hour of their shift and the environment is insanely hectic and noisy, not ideal for anyone. 

Good news! Since your guy is a mixed breed (with a breed that grows ‘furnishings’ aka face hair) his hair won’t be damaged the way a Pom’s would. I’ve never seen or even heard of a furnished dog’s hair being damaged by shaving/trimming *even if they have undercoat*. I’ve groomed a ton of weird mixes! I did a golden retriever/bouvier mix today! In fact, it’s possible your guy’s hair needs to be cut sometimes. Either way, there’s lots of possible cuts for every dog and honestly what the owner really truly wants is sometimes something no one has ever done before. If you show a pic of him pre-cut I can recommend some things you could ask for in future.

576,Petsmart,Petsmart,msxgmnu,1kp9kzh,2025-05-18,"Hot take probably. But not every store is some animal killing machine. We don’t throw out live animals. PERIOD. Yes, we do actually treat sick fish in the back. No, we do not hide animals to prevent them from being purchased- we WANT them to go to good homes. We deny sales if it’s not a good home. At my store at least, the pc team adores every single animal and most own 10+ pets (that they’ve mostly purchased from our store). If any animal shows the SLIGHTEST sign of being sick it’s an immediate vet appt or emergency vet appointment. We RARELY have animal deaths (minus fish). Not every petsmart store is some evil monster- and it took working here to realize that.",comment,167,,,https://reddit.com/r/petsmart/comments/1kp9kzh/petsmart_secrets/msxgmnu/,Petsmart
577,Petsmart,Petsmart,mjjwmpf,1jj2okz,2025-03-24,Keep in mind Petsmart has a lot of visitors so they have a great chance of finding adopters.  And usually the rescues have people going in there to play w the cats and kittens in the back most days.  It’s the best chance to find their permanent homes.  Maybe ask if they will allow you to visit them in the back and you can play with them every do often.  They may appreciate volunteers to clean the cages.  Also talk to adoption place about how best to find them homes eg in pairs etc.  I know it’s scary letting them go but realize you saved many fur babies and they are ready to find their permanent family.  Great job!!

3/3 or 4/2 (the slash is for lunch and then the amount of dogs before/after!) 


Sometimes Petsmarts are better/worse than others. I like mine and only work 2 1/2 days a week with college and make roughly $800 a week after taxes. If you get the add ons and have good clients you can make a lot! 

Most the salons I’ve worked in are super chill and helpful. I’m not afraid to ask questions, and turn dogs away if needed. We are fully backed up. If you power groom, which I would not recommend if you’re trying to perfect your skills, you get a shadow bather who fully washes & drys all your dogs.

580,Petsmart,Petsmart,mojbstk,1k5n082,2025-04-22,"That seems like way too many dogs for someone just starting. I can only tell you what it's like at petsmart: groomers bathe/dry their own dogs. When you first start out of academy you do 2 dogs a day and then gradually get brought up to a minimum of 5 a day. At my salon this was over the course of around a year for me tho I was also on medical leave for a few months, so give or take? Though corporate is starting to push 6 as the minimum and depending on the salon you end up at you might be expected to do that much which would be too much for someone who's new (I've been grooming for a year and I still can't finish 6 dogs in a day).


It's weird to me that you're only allowed to do one type of cut, I've never heard of that before 🫤 But it sounds like your company is very quantity over quality. Your grooms look great btw given the time frame! But you should be given more time to develop your skill since you're so new.

604,Petsmart,Petsmart,lqbemd5,1fw2c2t,2024-10-04,"Howdy y’all!

I’m Arlen Addison, dog trainer from Store 1780 in Houston, Tx. Since March, there’s been an ongoing national effort to unionize Petsmarts across America. 

We’re working with United Food & Commercial Workers (UFCW). They’re one of the largest unions in the US, with over 1+ million members.

This whole thing started with the attempted employee discount cut in March. That sparked associate outrage & we channeled that into an effort to unionize. [I made this famous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/petsmart/comments/1bl1bov/petsmart_workers_rise_up_share_our_poster_on/) &[ spoke at this union webinar in April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OuT-D6X65s&t=122s).

And after lots of work, the 1st Petsmart in America has won their union vote (21 to 2 in favor). Hats off to the workers at Store 0507 in Mishawaka, Indiana! They’re trailblazers & an inspiration to us all! Many more stores will soon follow their example! **✊**

If you want to unionize your Petsmart for Better Pay, Better Hours, & Better Conditions, fill out the form at [PetsmartUnion.org](http://PetsmartUnion.org) & a member of UFCW will help you get started!

Here’s a working template of enforceable union contract goals. Individual stores can modify it to fit their needs. This list was formed  after speaking with dozens of Petsmart workers across the country. Reply with feedback and/or suggestions.

611,Petsmart,Petsmart,m7kpwao,1i35ai3,2025-01-16,"This is exactly why I urge people to stop ""rescuing"" animals from PetSmart

It's just not worth it, they will happily let dozens die just to make that one sale, because it's still profitable due to how cheap they get these animals.

Unless they are literally giving you the animal for free, they're still going to profit off of the sale, which will only encourage them to continue selling these animals.

Please, go rescue beardies who need to be rehomed, stop supporting a terrible company by ""rescuing"" their intentionally mistreated animals.",comment,38,,,https://reddit.com/r/BeardedDragons/comments/1i35ai3/do_not_buy_beardies_from_petsmart/m7kpwao/,Petsmart
612,Petsmart,Petsmart,m7k7qye,1i35ai3,2025-01-16,"I do not support PETA on way too many things, but what they say about reptile breeding mills is absolutely true, it's a business filled with unimaginable nasty stuff for greed and profit. 

My sibling worked part time in a petsmart before, reptiles are transported to them in tiny containers in the back of vans with no AC, during winter in Canada it can fall to -40C, during summer the inside of a car trunk can get to 50C. Most are dead on arrival, usually less than 1/3 survive, the dead ones and the ones injured just get tossed out or flushed down the toilet.

oh, and their tiny 10gal enclosures at store are almost never cleaned properly, the workers are not allowed to do anything unless manager approves, so if they want to bring their own paper towels or fresh greens for the dragons, it can result in them getting scolded, and eventually fired, they don't care about the workers, plenty of people apply for the job everyday.

they also have to actively lie to customers about beginner kits being wonderful for them, red bulbs are good for night heating, reptile carpets are the best etc.

the effort to spread awareness on inhumane pet mills (this includes lots of ""reputable"" reptile stores, chain pet stores, large breeders who supply distributors that work with pet stores, etc) has been made for so long yet majority of owners who are uninformed or ignorant will still throw money at them. These corporations give owners the illusion that bearded dragon are cheap and easy pets, it's what most people want to hear. Their goal is to make sales and profit, not to care about animal's health and well-being.

most people don't like hearing ""this is an exotic animal that must have it's needs met in captivity, including at least a 4x2x2ft enclosure, T5HO UVB, fresh greens and live insects etc in order to thrive"".

they would rather hear ""it's super easy to care for, this beginner kit has everything you need, if you buy a dragon from us too, you get 20% off everything!""",comment,44,,,https://reddit.com/r/BeardedDragons/comments/1i35ai3/do_not_buy_beardies_from_petsmart/m7k7qye/,Petsmart
613,Petsmart,Petsmart,mi8w69y,1jd4dxi,2025-03-17,"Real. Absolutely real.  

Started with the company as a bather in 2012. Constantly told you can’t leave we will sue you. I was absolutely stressed to the max constantly. Was told I had to do 8 dogs a day or I would be terminated. Absolutely killed myself for years to do 8 dogs per 8 hours. 

End of 2022 we got a new store manager. They start saying some crazy stuff about grooming and the groomers.  I get pulled in the office and told you do 8 a day we would like for you to be doing 10. We would also like for you to start training the other groomers to go to 8 appointments a day. I said I wasn’t comfortable doing 10 dogs a day. It’s not safe for us or the dogs.  I told them a lot of the other stylists are brand new. It’s not my responsibility to train. Also how can I do more dogs and train at the same time? 

A few days later another groomer called in and instead of rescheduling their dogs management placed their dogs in my schedule. How many ?

10.  

I told manager on duty this was not safe I had already spoken to them about it. Manager said “I’m not a groomer what do you expect me to do about it!?” 

It was 6 large dogs. 2 of them being Irish wolfhounds, 2 were Goldendoodles.  I don’t remember all of the breeds. I finished them all without incident but I had 0 help. Only 1 bather on schedule with me that was told they do their bath dogs only and leave.  When I finished I only had about 2 hours of overtime took me 10 hours. When I went to leave I told the same manager that I had finished but I was not going to be doing that again because it was not safe I was told “if it was not safe then why did you do it?” 

The next day I had to call in because I had pulled something in my neck with the wolfhounds and it was causing me to have migraines so bad I was throwing up.   Over the next few weeks I got to hear about myself from management about how I am lazy. Don’t ask that employee to do anything because they are going to get mad and call out.  

About a week after this a client comes into the salon and proceeds to cuss all of us out. Threaten us.  Tell us to eat shit and die. Calling us slurs. I asked the client to leave as my manager was in the back on the phone with the store leader hiding from the client while we took the verbal abuse and threats.  I asked the client to please leave. 


I got terminated.  I had 0 write ups 0 pips. Nothing. 11 years with petsmart they destroyed my body.  I struggle grooming now. I have constant hip pains.  

I groom for myself now and it is much less work than dealing with this company and I get 100% instead of 50% 

I deeply regret the 11 years I gave to this company because it’s obvious they didn’t give a damn what happens to me or any of us. 

So do it.  Quit. 

I told HR I was afraid the client was going to pull a gun and shoot us and the lady started laughing saying it wasn’t their problem. That things like that just don’t happen at Petsmart.
