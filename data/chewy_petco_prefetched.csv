She was the “last thing” I have from when my family was still together and when i had rose colored glasses on so felt like we were happy. It brought up a lot of family issues on top of everything so I’ve really been struggling this month. My chihuahua, Chewy, and her were also very close so he was definitely grieving the first few days but seems to be okay now. Although he still always sniffs her grave and the flowers on it but will never step on it. My other kitty lily hides a lot so it was hard to see how she was doing. 

When chewy had his neck issue chewy helped me so much when I had issues with auto ship and returns. I mentioned chewy being hurt and explained the situation with the first vet bringing up euthanasia although it was 2 weeks in and my second vet said their steroid dose was half of what he should be on and shocked they didn’t even do Steroid injections. So many people hopped into the email chain wishing us well and it made me feel so much support during the hard time. 

I ordered an obnoxious amount of cat treats since it was buy 1 get 1 half off and they were Boo’s favorite. I haven’t seen them in the store in awhile and they were much cheaper. I had to email them for another return and added that Boo passed but thanked them for having her treats in stock so although i had no clue it was going to be her final few days, she was able to enjoy her favorite treats. Again people hopped onto the email chain wishing me all the love. 

I only set up a profile on chewy for chewy (totally forgot I did that) and it has a photo of him. They sent it to my dad’s house on accident but he brought it over. can you believe someone at chewy painted this canvas of my little guy FOR FREE and with a card basically saying we hope you like this and we’re showing you how much we care. 

I literally cannot stop staring at the canvas. It looks so much like him (I added the photo of I’m for comparison). I’ve never felt so much love from a company. 😭🥹❤️ I loved shopping there at first because they return your money but have you just donate the item to a shelter or someone in need which is beautiful. I had to return a bag of dry food my girls didn’t like but kept it for the local stray cats (one is basically mine were working on trying to get him to come in). But the fact that I got so much sympathy and love during two very difficult times and now this canvas. I will never not shop there. 


Sorry for the rambling. This year was just do hard dealing with Chewy’s injury and now losing my bear and for a company to treat me like this really warmed my heart. ",post,764,1,63,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf0cf9,Chewy

The company is grabagun. I'm in this industry. I've looked at Amazon and chewy to learn what multipliers for ecom businesses could be.

The TLDR is that this company is not even a strong brand, it has 4% EBITDA, is way low tech compared to Amazon or chewy, has no major advantage in the industry. Made $99M last year, but somehow is being valued with a 37x EBITDA?

Like many of you, I've enjoyed the sammies from Nightingale since they hit the scene almost a decade ago, though admittedly I haven't had as many recently. I learned that as of this year, they are distributed nationwide through Kroger and Costco. I picked up a box of the Strawberry Shortcake ""chomp size"" at Costco, but was very disappointed with what I got.

The sandwiches were wierdly soft, almost gummy or chewy. The ice cream itself was kind of stretchy? I looked online to see if others noticed this and found one person who described the sandwiches as ""marshmellow or mochi-like"" in their consistency, and I'd agree. I've previously had to let the sandwiches thaw before digging in, but no matter how cold I got these, they were still unnaturally soft. I looked at the ingredients, and sure enough it has a bunch of different gums, emulsifiers, stabilizers, etc. I'm no food chemist, but I'm pretty sure those things were to blame for the unpleasant texture.

Someone mentioned in a comment here that their ingredients got worse as the company got bigger, so I tried to compare the ingredients, but couldn't find the old ingredient list. Cynically, I would expect that to be true, but it's a shame because I had wanted to celebrate our hometown heroes getting deserved recognition.

9,Chewy,chewy company,1hlikqj,N/A,2024-12-24,"At my wit's end, considering surrendering at this point My cat (six year old male Maine coon/Himalayan mix) has caused actual property damage to my apartment with how he insistently keeps peeing in front of my door. As in he has stained the vinyl flooring and the painted wooden floor trim. He poops and OCCASIONALLY pees in the litter box so it's not that he doesn't get the concept, but he will do one in the box, step out, then do the other on the floor. I will go over and clean it up and not two minutes later he's gone back to do it again, even with a freshly scooped box right there.

I took him to the vet and she couldn't find anything wrong with an ultrasound. She had me put him on very expensive Royal Canin Urinary Calm food. Tried that for months, it did nothing besides make his hairballs worse. I tried a Feliway plug-in near the door in case it was stress about me leaving, nothing. Tried two litter boxes at my old place for two cats, also didn't stop him. It just gave him two boxes to pee next to. I've tried different litters, I've even tried this Cat Attract stuff to sprinkle in there that my mom gave me. It feels like I'm out of options.

I can't have company over because I'm paranoid and embarrassed about the smell. (I don't even smell anything anymore, hence the paranoia because no matter how much I clean, I can't tell how noticeable it is.) Not to mention I'm anxious about bringing someone home and opening the door to find a puddle of pee smack in front of us as their first impression to my place. My (suspected) contamination OCD makes cleaning up after him incredibly stressful. I have cried about having to do so before and I'm not proud. Plus I hate being near my entryway because it never really feels clean, especially with the stains.

I love him so, SO much. He was my first cat that I adopted on my own once I moved out after college and he's best friends with my other anxious little girl cat who I fear would be a nervous wreck if I surrendered him. But also I'm on the edge of yet another nervous breakdown about how much of my life revolves around cat piss and the cleaning/avoidance thereof.

Some advice would be appreciated. Either on new things to try, or if you guys think surrendering would be the best option at this point, addressing the feeling that I'm a bad cat parent and shouldn't have cats at all going forward if I couldn't handle this.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. Since it's been asked a few times, yes he is neutered. No I will not be letting him outside because I live near major roads. And no, his litter isn't scented I'm not sure how people got that idea. I've tried various ""deodorizing"" kinds, but never scented.

Also because a few people have mentioned, yes I have tried puppy pads. This big dumb good boy knows he shouldn't pee ON things, so he just pees right next to them and it seeps under them and it honestly just widens the disaster zone.

It sounds like my next option is going to be trying the ""kitty prozac"" my vet suggested. She made it sound like it was going to be a big expense for life when we talked so I hadn't gone that route yet, but I'll be happy to shop around and see what prices through Chewy and Costco are like.",post,46,0.88,205,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetAdvice/comments/1hlikqj/at_my_wits_end_considering_surrendering_at_this/,Chewy

How is FedEx allowed to get away with having drivers come in and load trucks for anywhere from 1 - 3 hours and not pay them? 

I usually come in and put in, on average, 2 hours of loading my truck. This can entail anything from fixing the the horrible job the loaders have done up to that point, or having to put away everything that the loaders just dumped at the end of it and never bothered to put away. To add to this, my contractor just told us a couple of weeks ago that FedEx now has a rule that states that as soon as we enter our trucks to start doing anything, the loaders are not required to put anything else on the shelves. 

I've also been told, after asking my boss about this, that if I have a problem with not getting paid to do this that I can just come in later after the loaders are done. This ignores the fact that

A. The loaders do a shit job 99% of the time. 
B. There are days that I have come in after the loaders are done and gone, and there's half of my truck just sitting in a pile at the back of my truck.

There are a couple of drivers who come in, move a couple things and then leave within 15 minutes of arriving. I can't work like that. I need to have my truck in order. If I just took my truck out as is, I'd be out there for at least 2 more hours looking for stuff or trying to get 120lb bookcases out of the back of my truck that were loaded behind the driver seat and has 6 Chewy boxes on top of it. 

I've yet to hear a reason why we are expected to do this work and yet don't get paid until we're out on the road delivering. Yeah, I only deliver for about 5 hours a day, but I have to put in about 2 extra hours doing this every day, so the money I'm being paid isn't really for a 5 hour day, more like 7-8 hours. But time and again, I've heard from my bosses and even FedEx themselves on the rare times when I've gone to safety meetings in the morning - you don't get paid until you get to your first stop. 

Seems really shitty that this company's working model is to depend on drivers to do unpaid labor so they can send the loaders home asap to keep their payroll budget in check. ",post,21,0.93,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedexers/comments/1jhq1xd/can_someone_please_explain_this_to_me/,Chewy
11,Chewy,chewy company,1iwj2xl,N/A,2025-02-23,"Follow up post: Angry Chewy customer from yesterday (Feb 22). I submitted a detailed complaint via their email option on the website to which asupervisor called me. She handled it like a star and I hope she gets a promotion. Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/s/fkCuVau6pi

The tl;dr from my previous post is that Chewy sent me prescription food instead of the correct food with my recurring order. The whole thing involved multiple customer support calls with inconsistent responses and what I consider them holding my dogs food hostage until I corrected their mistake.

Claire, the supervisor from Chewy, was absolutely stellar. She read through my complaint, listened to my audio calls and agreed that Chewy was at fault and mishandled the situation. She apologized and seemed to genuinely care for my concerns. 

Ultimately Claire sent a second package of food along with the original package and issued a full refund. Claire went above and beyond to make things right, even though she could see that I'd already canceled my subscription - a subscription that I do believe I will be renewing thanks to her.

A lot of you got on a high horse saying that this is just business as usual that I should stop being so overly dramatic. Quite a few of you even accused me of lying because this experience did not align with your own. All I can say is that I am happy that not on you are the ones representing these companies customer service.

12,Chewy,chewy.com,1hbwuvj,N/A,2024-12-11,"Bad experiences with Chewy.com? Has anyone else had a terrible experience this last year with Chewy.com? 

I recently ordered dog treats from Chewy during their Black Friday sales. It was a total of 14 bags of treats for around $40. I added enough to my cart to receive several discount codes, a free item and free shipping. I only ever order from Chewy in bulk, so I can benefit from their free shipping for orders over $50. 

This time, I never received my order. When I contacted a representative, they sent a FedEx delivery link with a photo of the delivery- the photo containing my package was not anywhere I recognized. I told this to the representative and they authorized a replacement order to be sent. I received a confirmation email about the replacement order, and an estimated delivery date. 

My replacement package was due to be delivered between Saturday and Tuesday. It is now Wednesday, a whole week and a half after originally ordering my items, and I still have not received them. 

I contacted Chewy today, to inquire about my package again. I was told by the representative that my package was “on its way”, and the representative closed out the chat before I could respond. 

This is not the first time that I have not received my package on time. One of the perks Chewy promotes is that their delivery is within 1-2 days of placing the order. I had ordered dog food earlier this year on two separate occasions and it did not arrive on time. Because of the late delivery, I had to go out and purchase dog food from my local pet store, entirely defeating the purpose of utilizing Chewy.com. 

I understand that it is close to the holidays now, and I am sure that delivery is a nightmare this time of year. However, I paid for a product, even paying more for additional services like free shipping, only to not receive my product or any relevant information regarding it. I don’t understand why Chewy would promote sales and services for their products if they are not able to follow through appropriately.

18,Chewy,chewy.com,1i4hor6,N/A,2025-01-18,"Chewy.com repacking pet food! So I ordered some products from Chewy.com the other day and today when I got the package I noticed both the cat and dog food boxes were open and the cans were rolling around inside the chewy box. I thought cool no big deal but then I remember how I saw multiple reviews of people saying the same thing happens when they get their orders. 

Thinking to myself that’s weird, I started looking at the cans and realized the cans had different expiration dates and even the box they came from had a different expiration date. 

For dog food I ordered Blue Buffalo 6-count Homestyle Recipe (3 cans of chicken, 3 cans of beef). The beef cans are dated for October 15, 2027 and the chicken are dated for July 25th, 2027, also one of the Lot numbers is off from the other 5 cans. And the Blue Buffalo box the cans came in has a date of April 2, 2027.

Cat food I got Fancy Feast Seafood Classic Pâté (24 cans) and all the dates in the cans and box are the same but some of the lot numbers on the cans match and others do not.

It looks like chewy is opening the products they get from these companies and repacking them. The only reason I can think of them doing this is maybe they are buying certain things in bulk and repacking them to diversify their inventory so they can offer a bigger variety of products to the consumers? Or maybe they are repacking older products they have been sitting on to sell them off before the newer stuff? Some of the cans are dented too so maybe they get a discount on dented stuff and resell it to us for normal price?? 

I’m but sure but this feels sketchy and seems like one more thing companies are doing to get over on us. I don’t think they are allowed to repack products but I’m not a lawyer 🤷🏽‍♀️

27,Chewy,chewy dog,1hlmgmz,N/A,2024-12-24,"Neighbor obsessed with my rural farm animals POSTER UPDATE -2-22-25:

First, I want to thank everyone for reading my post and taking the time to respond. I have read most of the responses.  Because there are so many I haven't been able to read all of them, but intend to.  I am providing an update today:  
  
When I moved here over five years ago it was my intention to have good relationships with all my neighbors. It really upsets me that all this has happened and I'm unable to find a better solution. However, looking back on this I can see where I should have set better boundaries from the beginning. 

A few responses to comments:  
This is not an old demented woman. She is in her 40's, very cognitively intact. However, I do believe she has mental health issues, primarily very needy, over medicated and in need of drama and attention. Although I am not mental health professional, as a Registered Nurse the term 'Borderline Personality Disorder' best describes her behavior and what has been occurring. APS ( Adult Protective Services) won't deal with this issue. 

Husband: Since I have lived her the husband regularly drinks ( and drives). He supports his wife and believes what he is told. Hopefully, after he reads the Attorney's letter with multiple pages listing just some of what she's done over the years he'll be enlightened and stop supporting her behavior. He is generally a very nice, kind 'no confrontation' type of person and has never directly communicated with me int he way she has. Until his recent text to me I thought he was totally neutral in all this.



Since my original posting:

\* I hired an Attorney to send a formal letter of 'Cease and Desist'.  It was a good letter, a copy mailed to both this woman and her husband. It was multiple pages and listed just some of the issues that have occurred over the last five years and demanding they both stop contacting me, making false reports to law enforcements and stop luring my cats  up to their property""  It's only been one week, but I haven't heard anything since and I am hoping I never will. 

Just a few days prior to them receiving this letter I received a cell phone text from the husband ( I have already blocked the woman, husband and all family on Messenger & FB.) Husband wanted to let me know he saw me taking pictures, apparently assuming I was taking pictures of their property?  Also scolded me for being out on my property at night when it's dark. His Text:  "" l saw you taking pictures today in the driveway if you need photos of anything just let me know and I can send them to you. Also creeping around at night with out a flashlight makes it look like a prowler is on your property.  .  .  . Just so your aware several cats are hanging around over here again.    
I was out taking pictures of MY property in preparation for some work done on the property and trees.  He was not home when I was taking pictures with my cell phone. I don't think he understands that his wife has been luring my cats up there, feeding them which is why they are 'hanging around'  
Initially I did not respond. However, felt I needed to say something, especially as I knew the letter from the Attorney was already mailed and on it's way. I responded feeling this is my one and only - and last opportunity to speak up before the letters arrive. ""  I certainly do not need you to provide pictures to me of my own property.   
For the last five years I have gone out at night to check on my livestock and do not need your permission to do so. It is absolutely NONE of your business what I do on my property.  You both need to mind your business.   
Do NOT contact me again EVER for ANYTHING.  Your number is now blocked and I will not be reading or responding to any texts from either of you. 

Per discussion with my Attorney, if anything occurs, any false reports of animal abuse / neglect, find anything more tossed in my pasture or harassment from them, then a Protective Order will be requested

SIGNAGE:  
\*I have correct signage on the fence facing this neighbor: 1. "" NOTICE: Do not touch or feed the animals"" - 2. ""No Trespassing - Property Protected by Video Surveillance, Trespassers Prosecuted"".  I get a lot of deliveries from FedEx, Amazon, Chewy, etc and didn't want my signage to interfere with deliveries so have another sign stating: ""Family, Friends & Deliveries Welcome - All Others Are Trespassing""

\* LURING & FEEDING MY BARN CATS ONTO THEIR PROPERTY:  
The County Animal Control Officer told her to stop putting out food and luring my cats onto her property. However, neither of us can make her stop doing that.  They are free roaming barn cats and it's normal for them to be out and about all over my property. I have one cat that has been missing for well over a month and last seen at their property. The boundary of my property, barn and pasture is less than 50 feet from her back door. The other cat was going up there, however is here at home more and I know she is safe and well. Unfortunately, once the cats have been made welcome by this neighbor feeding them, it's very hard if not impossible to keep them home.

\*BARRIER:  
I purchased the additional fencing to run a secondary fence line about 30 ft inside the existing fence line. This fence will be 6 feet and I have two 50 ft tarps that will hang along that fence line. I need to get some trees trimmed, one removed, etc before I can do that. Also it's February, the ground is frozen and I will need to wait until I can pound in the T-Posts. 

CAMERAS:  
I have additional cameras up in the front of the pasture. Unfortunately, those are battery WYZE and have their limitations. I purchased Netgear Nighthawk Web System consisting of three boxes and have been working this last week to provide internet reception up front to support the cameras. 

FINANCES:  This has taken a bit longer than I would  have liked, however it has all been very costly. Attorney is approx: $1,000, additional fencing well over $1,000, cameras and internet mesh at least another $1,000. I have pulled funds from my IRA for all of this, but feel it's necessary. 

ON A POSTIVE NOTE:  
The rescue I work with has been asking for me to take additional animals. I have been reluctant because of this neighbor's behavior. Since having the Attorney involved and letter sent I am feeling more confident and safer here now.  I have accepted a new llama that came from a neglect situation and he will live out  his life here with the alpacas and other animals. 

I have 'guests' of 7 hens and one (very loud) rooster staying with me temporarily as their owners lost their home to a fire. Once they get established in a new home, this 'flock' will return to their family. In the meantime, they also are getting fresh blueberries and oatmeal, 'bugs' in the afternoon and are very well feed!

I am hoping to arrange some educational events for local school children in the coming months. I have also inquired into 4H and if there are kids that need a place to keep a 4H animal free of charge.  It will be nice to finally be able to utilize this property as I intended when I bought it. 

Thank you again to everyone that has been supportive and offering suggestions.  You are all awesome!  
I probably won't post another update unless something happens. 



===========================

POSTER UPDATE:

PERSONALITY / DEMENTIA: Unfortunately, I don't believe this is an issue of dementia. I wish it was that simple. She is in her early 40's, kids are all grown and out of the house, she stays home, doesn't work because she says her knees bother her. It seems that she always has 'drama' in her life which is made worse because she has too much time on her hands. She is frequently having an issue with her husband who she says is mean to her when he attempts to draw financial boundaries, cut off the Debit Card after she runs it down with daily trips into town for Starbucks, has medical issues she needs help with, etc. It's always something and whatever it is, it makes her the center of attentions.  As a Registered Nurse for over 30 years I've deal with a fair amount of people with issues and this person seems to fall under the term: ""Borderline Personality"" if anything, but not dementia. I have tolerated this behavior only because we're neighbors, I have felt it important to try very hard to keep a good relationship with all of my neighbors and these particular neighbors as I have to share a driveway, etc.  Within months of me moving in here she was trying to get me to let family members move in and asking me for help and money, etc.

SHERIFF / TRESSPASS:  
I requested a Deputy came out to 'Trespass Her' which has been done. I asked them to include not just staying off my property, but no further contact and no feeding animals or putting stuff in the pasture or she would be arrested. I am concerned that she isn't going to just let it rest and waiting for the 'other shoe to drop'.

RESTRAINING ORDER: I have made calls and looking into this. Odds are my particular issue does not fall into any of the accepted categories.

ATTORNEY LETTER:  Out of six Attorneys I left messages for only one called back. She was very nice but declined to help. She did however educate me that spending over $500 on a letter and follow up would do basically nothing as it's a 'threat' and if she violated the demands in the letter I would just have to go and have her arrested which I can already do with the Sheriff Trespassing her.

PASTURE:  
On this property the prior owner used it as a professional dog kennel / breeding facility. It has a huge outbuilding at one end of the pasture and a separate old barn. My house is on the other side of that building separated by a creek and lots of trees so I cannot see what goes on in the pasture from the house. The far end of the pasture has the 3 foot chain link fence, then the neighbors shared driveway, then their backdoor.

BARRIER:  
I appreciate so much everyone's comments and advice. I am purchasing 'Red Barn' Black No Climb 6 foot fence and will be running a line of this fencing about 20-30 feet this side of that initial 3 foot chain link fence. This will create a large 'ally' keeping the animals away from the fence line along with anything she may throw over the fence. Then on suggestion from someone I will put up a black mesh tarp along that entire fenceline to block the view and wind. All total this will cost well over $1,500. I have pulled some money from savings (ROTH) and waiting on that check to fund this fencing

CAMERAS:  
I have about a dozen WYZE cameras between the house and pasture. They generally work well but the motion sensor is only triggered by objects fairly close so it will not trigger and record when folks are way up at that fence line.  I can turn the camera on, sit and watch it, but I need it to act as the other cameras.  I am researching to find a way to get wifi up at that far end of the pasture. I have it half way but it won't pick up that far. I am looking at extenders, etc.  As soon as I do I have ordered additional WYZE cameras that I will put at that far end of the fence line.

I have ordered NetGear Mesh system and it should be here within two weeks. I am familiar with this as I use it at the house. I will put the main router in the pump house with the Starlink Router, a satellite in the red barn which will be closest to that neighbor fence line. This should get me clear and consistent coverage.

MY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY:  
During the last few years as this has been occurring I have honestly felt I was overreacting and afraid to set boundaries, etc. I did 'politely' tell her not to feed the animals, but that lasted a short time.

The many comments you all have taken the time to provide has given me the confidence that I am right and it is appropriate to take actions against her behavior. I've really thought long and hard about all this and there waere many opportunities I had in the past to have the Sheriff Trespass her and was afraid to. That was my responsibility and I failed ( cowardly) There was an 'incident' that I could have handled better, however . . .it was probably for the best it happened. I had been working in the pasture and watching for when the neighbor pulled in. As soon as she did I walked up to the fence line and initiated a conversation ( not really in the best way) I said 'Really (Name) . . you called the Sheriff.  Her response was to yell: ""F\*\*\* Y\*\*' and made a statement about how ALL my animals are dying. This threw me and I've only had two of these animals die in the last 5+ years, the Rescue Org and Vet all said it was not related to anything I did, poor care or nutrition, etc  
Well . . .I lost it.  In my 65 years I have NEVER been this angry at anyone or talked to anyone this way. And I don't recall ever using the language I did that day. I yelled at her: ""You F\*\*\*\*\*\* B\*\*\*\*\* . . you come never my property or animals I will have you arrested. She then yelled back about how all my animals are dying and it's 'suspcious'. Keep in mind I have recents texts from her about how well I take care of my animals and how well fed they are. I make the chickens oatmeal with blueberries and meal worms for goodness sake!.  I continued to yell: ""I have dealt with you mental instability for years and am no longer!  You even look over here and I will have you arrested and make sure you spend time in jail.  Actually.  . . although I could have handled it better . .everything better. . .it sort of felt good to yell at her.

Thanks everyone ( except for the one nasty person) who has been offering helpful advice. I am reading and considering everything. Mostly, you folks have assured me it's OK to set boundaries, trespass her, etc.

===============  
Neighbor obsessed with my rural farm animals, overstepping, trespassing.  
I have lived on my five acre rural property for over six years and have always tried to maintain a good relationship with all surrounding neighbors. I have senior rescue animals ( alpaca, chickens, etc) that I have adopted and it is anticipated they will live out their lives on my property. The rescue organization visits my property as well as a Veterinarian. My animals are well taken care of.  
I have an older female stay at home neighbor who is overly involved in my animals, has come onto my property to feed them without permission including going into my barn and pulling hay to feed my llama without permission. )The hay she pulled had been set aside as it was contaminated with cleaning fluid and needed to be destroyed.) She has also thrown food, soup bones, toys over the pasture fence for my new LGD ( Livestock Guardian Dog) / GP (Great Pyrenees) after being told. Behavior includes sending me multiple texts how my alpacas are upset that it is raining and she is singing to them, my chicken is in distress (it was laying an egg). I have texts from her confirming she is feeding my barn cats and encouraging them to stay at her property and I am having difficulty keeping them home, then telling her husband I am neglecting them.  
I have in the past included and allowed her to visit the animals in an attempt to keep a good neighborly relationship. however she is unable to maintain normal boundaries in her behavior and emotional involvement with my animals  
Recently I had an alpaca pass away for the first time. This is a very difficult time even though anticipated. This neighbor, who knew nothing of the details called the local sheriff to report me for animal abuse / neglect.  I did confront this neighbor whose only response was : ""F\*\*\* You"".  
I have had enough and no longer feel it necessary or even possible to maintain a good neighborly relationship. I am exploring options from having her trespassed by the Sheriff, having an attorney send a letter of warning ( harassment, etc), some sort of protective / restraining order.  
I should also mention that as we share a driveway and their back door is closer to my pasture then my own home is, in the name of 'neighborly friendship' I have been there for her to listen to her marital issues, given her money, etc. She is currently driving impaired on a daily basis ( prescription meds) and has totaled two vehicles in the last few months.  
I'm looking for any advice on how to deal with this woman, create boundaries, keep her from throwing food and toys in my pasture and calling my animals ( cats ) to her property and feeding them.

PASTURE:  
This property used to be a professional dog kennel / breeding facility. It has a huge outbuilding at one end of the pasture. My house is on the other side of that building separated by a creek and lots of trees so I cannot see what goes on in the pasture from the house.

Then on suggestion from someone I will put up a black mesh tarp to block the view and wind. This will create an ally and keep the animals from going up to the edge of the fence.

SHERIFF / TRESSPASS:  
I called, asked and a Deputy came out to 'Trespass Her'. I asked them to include not just staying off my property, but no further contact and no feeding animals or putting stuff in the pasture or she would be arrested. I am concerned that she isn't going to just let it rest.

30,Chewy,chewy dog,1kmmniz,N/A,2025-05-14,"How does Milk-Bone Soft Chewy Dog Treats stack up? Honest review! Having spent a solid month testing Milk-Bone 10829274006177 Soft & Chewy Dog Treats, Beef & Filet Mignon Recipe, I can confidently provide some insights you’ll want to hear if you’re considering these for your dog. My furry companion, Max, a middle-aged Labrador with a penchant for tasty snacks, and my sister’s toy Poodle, Bella, put these treats through the wringer. Here's everything you need to know.

**Texture and Flavor – Dog Approved**

The first thing that struck me about these treats was their soft, chewy texture. Max usually prefers to gnaw on harder treats, but these were perfect for him, especially after a recent dental cleaning. Bella, being a smaller dog with a more delicate jaw, also had no issues chomping on these. The fact that they are made with real chuck roast and are fortified with 12 essential vitamins and minerals was a bonus for me as a pet owner. The beef and filet mignon flavor must be a hit because I couldn't get Max to sit still the moment I popped the lid. Surprisingly, even picky Bella wagged her tail impatiently every time I reached for the canister.

[Ready for Milk-Bone 10829274006177? Explore Amazon pricing here.](https://petof.com/p/b006hka6ii/)

**Packaging and Portioning**

Another aspect I appreciated was the convenient 25-ounce canister. It’s sturdy and resealable, keeping the treats fresh for weeks. With Max being approximately 80 pounds, I usually give him one full treat, and for Bella, a quarter of one suffices. They’re easy to break into smaller pieces, which ensures I can control the portion size depending on how “good” my pups have been that day.

**Favorable Attributes**

- Soft and chewy texture suits dogs of all sizes and ages.  
- Made with real beef for a more authentic flavor.  
- Fortified with 12 vitamins and minerals, promoting general health.  

**Feeding Directions and Ingredients**

The instructions are straightforward: these treats are designed to be fed as part of a healthy diet. For smaller breeds, breaking them into tinier pieces is recommended. I like that Milk-Bone emphasizes moderation and insists on monitoring your pet while treating. However, it’s worth checking the ingredient list for dogs with allergies. While most dogs are fine with the formula, those highly sensitive to beef or certain grains might not react as favorably. Thankfully, Max and Bella had no issues.

**Shortcomings**

- High aroma might not suit owners who dislike strong-smelling treats.  
- Might seem overly soft to those who prefer crunchy treats for dental benefits.  

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

As much as these treats work as rewards for good behavior, they also shined during training sessions. Their pliable nature allowed me to stuff them into puzzle toys for mental stimulation, and breaking them into tiny bits worked wonders when teaching Bella a new trick. I even used them to help Max adjust to wearing his new harness during our morning walks.

**Direct Competitors**

Looking at similar treat options on the market, Blue Buffalo Blue Bits is a rival many dog owners might recognize. The Blue Bits are soft and contain real chicken, but they don't have as broad a flavor profile as Milk-Bone’s beef and filet mignon recipe. Milk-Bone edges out with its slightly larger package size for a comparable cost, but Blue Bits might appeal to those seeking grain-free alternatives. On the other hand, Greenies Pill Pockets are softer but focused more on packaging pills rather than as a general treat. It really depends on your specific needs, though Max would argue Milk-Bone’s flavor wins every time.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Considering the generous 25-ounce canister and the wholesome ingredients, I’d say these treats fall into the “bang for the buck” category. Some high-end dog snacks are priced significantly higher for smaller quantities, but these deliver great quality at a reasonable cost. I’ve noticed the brand has been trustworthy over the years, and the long shelf life is another weight off my shoulders when stocking up.

42,Chewy,chewy cat,1iah1ib,N/A,2025-01-26,"My cat won’t stop vacuuming I recently got a robot vacuum for Christmas and was worried about it scaring our 1 year old cat. The day we set it up, my cat followed the vacuum around for hours playing with it. 

The vacuum is suppose to charge itself, and then vacuum at scheduled times. As soon as the vacuum went back to it’s charging dock the cat kept playing with it until he eventually realized that not only do the buttons make a fun beeping noise, but they also make the vacuum move around. 

It’s been almost a month and my cat still turns on the vacuum for hours everyday. Every time we send it back to its charging station, the cat uses the buttons to put in back in cleaning mode. I wake up in the middle of the night to find the cat vacuuming the bedroom if I forgot to cover the buttons at night. 

While I appreciate how clean he keeps the floors, I’m starting to worry we may have to sell the vacuum. 

Edit: thank you to everyone who pointed out that my cat may be using the vacuum to fulfill his enrichment needs. I got a Chewy gift card for Christmas, so I am going to look into some motorized or interactive cat toys, or at least some that are more stimulating then our current ones (we have the typical stuff like plastic balls with bells, fake mice, catnip filled toys, etc. Not much that is interactive). If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

45,Chewy,chewy cat,1j2phlj,N/A,2025-03-03,"All 5 of my cats got extremely sick from purina classic paté. 5 ER visits so far. Need advice for food so they can stay alive. Edit AGAIN: She has finally ate about 3 hours ago and is doing well so far. Her son’s second xray came back and he no longer has pancreatitis and the inflammation is nearly completely gone.  He is back to normal, eating, peeing, pooping, cuddling. She is acting better now that she has ate, she wants more but I know to wait she can’t eat everything at once. She also will have a checkup tomorrow or the next day to get another xray to see how she’s improved compared to her son. Also, I am extremely grateful to the people who gave me actual advice. And to the people who have either messaged me or commented dealing with the same situation I’m so sorry and I can only hope your babies are going to be okay, report it to the FDA, to Purina and if it was chewy like most of us, get a refund for it. I’m unable to reply to anyone and can’t physically or emotionally deal with going through negative Reddit vets who do not even know the whole story or anyone else’s or hasn’t even researched. Very easy to search it up, so many people dealing with this batch causing the same illness in their cat(s). Also, the first cat to start showing severe sickness has been fine the past 8 days or more since getting help & cutting him off from the food. 

Edit to add: I do not care to argue the cause, considering timeline and who ate what and how much and many other factors I don’t have time to explain I need my cat to eat, 4 vets, 2 clinics and hundreds of others going through this right now with this batch all know the cause. Even purina does or they wouldn’t be paying peoples medical bills, give me advice on what to feed my dying cats PLEASE. I do not care to argue on if purina would recall fancy feast, they’ve made cats sick last year and there was NO RECALL. They’re paying everyone’s vet bills and refunding all the food. To my knowledge, hundreds have reported this and my 3 vets have, my brothers vet has, and other owners and vets dealing with this have. Still no recall. This isn’t new for purina to not recall. Please just give me advice on what food is like crack for cats so my babies who are struggling to recover can eat. Thank you. 

So the past 2 weeks have been horrific. If you feed your cat purina fancy feast wet food id steer clear from all of it but specifically the classic pâtés. I am exhausted from 2 weeks of being up 24/7 to try and save my cats, but it started out with either lethargy & disinterest in food and or projectile vomiting & throwing up over and over and over again. Duke threw up over 30 times. After they all ran this course including blood in their puke at some point due to inflammation of their gastrointestinal system, they would not eat or drink anything. These cats are cats who are ALWAYS hungry to the point of it being annoying. Well that all stopped. Their X-rays showed their ENTIRE gastrointestinal system from top to bottom to be EXTREMELY inflamed. Dx with severe IBD & pancreatitis. Serial number 43 is what’s really made them sick. I won’t continue to go on because I need something my 3 cats will eat whom are still recovering.

I have given them over 30 plus choices of food so far. Nothing. Even with cerenia and an appetite stimulant, they will not eat. They don’t want boiled chicken, no tuna, aq no treats, 20 different cans of food of all different types of meat, nothing. 10 different packages of wet junk food squeezable pouches and 6 pouches of gravies& broth. Only 1 choice of dry food. Nothing. 

This will be nalas 7th day without food ( yes she went to the ER and got some hydration & other things 2 days ago) she will not eat anything. What’s a food that’s like crack for them? Dry food or wet either works she needs to eat. None of my cats like those go gurt like pouch treats before and currently. Obviously I will not be giving them fancy feast, they don’t want it either before finding out it was the cause they knew something was wrong with it :( ",post,289,0.86,429,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1j2phlj/all_5_of_my_cats_got_extremely_sick_from_purina/,Chewy

Curious what homemade foods would pair with the urinary restrictions? My cat has been on CD urinary food for years and we realized that after enough time passes--she simply gets tired of eating specific brands/flavors. We started with Hills..whose options are chicken & oceanfish. After a few years of back and forth she wasn't finishing half a meal portion. We checked with the vet to confirm this wasn't a health issue and just pickiness. So I switched to a Purina alternative that had more gravy and solid chunks which she loved immediately (1 of the 2 flavors anyways). After 6 months of this she's getting sick of Purina. The vet suggested boiled chicken and sure enough she ate that up...but that can't be a full replacement as it doesn't have the same nutritional value. At this point I think we need to just buy as many different brands as possible and switch them up daily. The only issue is Chewy has limited options. I would just like to see what else is out there.,post,2,0.75,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1hs6l8r/any_suggestions_for_cd_urinary_food_chewy_has/,Chewy

57,Chewy,chewy order,1giyqrb,N/A,2024-11-03,"AITA for telling my sister she's not allowed to bring her homemade food to Thanksgiving because her cooking is ruining the meal? Every year, our family does a big Thanksgiving dinner, and we all typically bring a dish or two. My sister, who’s a lovely person in every other way, insists on cooking something homemade every time. The issue? She’s… not a great cook. And I don’t mean just “not great”—I mean she has somehow managed to turn classic dishes into borderline inedible creations.

For context, last Thanksgiving, she showed up with her “special recipe” stuffing that was over-seasoned with random spices like cinnamon and cardamom. It was dry, and the flavors were confusing and totally off for stuffing. Only one person took a small bite, and the rest went untouched. Another year, she brought a green bean casserole that had some kind of strange, chewy texture—she later admitted she used coconut milk and almond flour “to experiment.” No one wanted seconds of that, either.

This year, I’m hosting Thanksgiving. Since I’m responsible for putting it all together, I wanted to keep the menu consistent so that people could actually enjoy a cohesive meal. I thought I’d avoid drama by asking her to bring non-food items instead—like wine, soda, or even some flowers. I explained to her (very kindly, I thought) that I just wanted to make things easy and streamlined, and I’d handle the main dishes. But she didn’t take it well.

She got offended and told me I was being “controlling” and “shutting her out” of the family gathering. She then accused me of making her feel inadequate and said that Thanksgiving is about everyone contributing, not me deciding what’s “acceptable.” I told her that everyone appreciates her effort, but that she could contribute in other ways and still be part of it. She doubled down and said she’s bringing her “famous” green bean casserole whether I like it or not.

Now, my mom and a couple of other family members have chimed in, saying I should just let her bring whatever she wants because “it’s Thanksgiving” and “it’s the thought that counts.” They’re acting like I’m committing some huge offense by wanting the food to be enjoyable for everyone and not have random experimental dishes that no one will eat.

But I feel like I’m just trying to keep the meal enjoyable and, frankly, edible. I don’t think it’s wrong to want guests to actually enjoy the food, especially since I’m putting in a lot of effort to host. Am I really being unreasonable here? AITA?

UPDATE: Alright, well, things have escalated fast. Thanks to everyone who offered advice—I tried to compromise, but it’s already turning into a whole thing, and Thanksgiving is still a few weeks away.

After our last conversation, my sister was being pretty cagey about what she planned to make, so I reached out to my mom, hoping she could help smooth things over. Instead, she got defensive, saying I’m “overthinking” and that it’s just one dish. I told her I wasn’t sure it was just one dish anymore, especially after hearing about my sister’s grocery haul (including canned oysters and edible glitter).

Then my mom let slip that my sister has been “hard at work” on some “creative menu” she’s planning as her “Thanksgiving surprise.” Apparently, she’s been telling the family group chat (which I wasn’t included in, by the way) that I’m being “controlling” and that she wants to “expand everyone’s palate” with something “truly unique.”

To top it off, my cousin sent me a screenshot from the group chat where my sister said she’s bringing not one but three dishes to Thanksgiving now. She’s calling them her “Thanksgiving Trio Experience,” complete with their own place settings and little menu cards she’s designing. I’m officially panicking because I have no idea what she’s planning to serve, and from what I’ve heard, it’s not remotely traditional.

At this point, half the family thinks I’m overreacting, while the other half is texting me with things like, “Is she really bringing glittered sweet potatoes?” I feel stuck—if I try to control it any more, I’m the bad guy, but if I don’t, Thanksgiving might turn into a tasting event for my sister’s avant-garde cooking.

So yeah, Thanksgiving is weeks away, and it’s already become a family spectacle. I don’t know whether to brace myself or just preemptively order pizza.",post,14390,0.95,5728,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1giyqrb/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_not_allowed_to/,Chewy

A few years ago, my family lost a pet, and we needed to stop the auto-ship for their food. Chewy immediately took care of the situation, no questions asked. But what really touched me was their kind suggestion that I donate the food order that was already in transit. It was a thoughtful gesture. A few days later, I received a beautiful bouquet of flowers at my home, along with sincere condolences from the entire Chewy family.

Recently, my dog, Molly, has been struggling with mobility issues (hopefully short-term). I bought stairs from Chewy to help her get onto the bed more easily, but Molly had other plans and made it clear that the stairs were not going to work for her! I contacted Chewy to arrange a return, and before I even finished the chat, they had already refunded my money. They once again suggested donating the stairs to a shelter or clinic.

This level of customer service is truly extraordinary, and I want to publicly share my appreciation for Chewy. Their kindness and responsiveness have left an impression on me.

I've:

* Sent multiple emails
* Reached out on Instagram
* Tried messaging on Facebook
* Even attempted Twitter

Radio silence. Not even an automated response.

Meanwhile, companies like Chewy get it right. Need help? Just call their direct phone number and talk to a real person who actually wants to help. What a concept!

I understand businesses get busy, but having ZERO way to speak to a human is unacceptable, especially for a company selling premium furniture. What if there's an issue with assembly? What if parts are missing? In my case, it's something trivial that any customer service rep could solve in minutes - if only I could reach one.

The bed frame I ordered isn't cheap - their website says they're all about quality and customer satisfaction. Well, I'm not feeling very satisfied right now.

Thuma, if you're reading this - please take a page from Chewy's book. Give your customers a way to actually reach you. A phone number. An email that gets responses. Something. Anything.

Our Chewy autoship for our 6 month supply of flea and heartworm preventatives came up and we got a notice from Chewy saying that our vet is requiring we mail a prescription. We were like huh? this has never been the case. So upon calling our vet they said they stopped doing 3rd party sellers (didn't feel the need to warn their clients with an email, but okay.) Fine, pricing appeared nearly identical, we will fill it through them. Attempt an order through them, but get a notice that no we can't get the heartworm Rx because our dog needs yearly bloodwork first (could have just said that the first time we called.) Fine, we bring him in. A $500 vet bill later, I ask if the heartworm order will go through now and they say I have to re-order on their online platform. Fine, I do just that. I get yet ANOTHER ding from the vet that the order has been denied because we can only order a max dose of 3 - which is literally MORE expensive than just getting the 6 month supply - what we have ALWAYS done the 5 years we've had our dog and have been going there.

We like our vet but what the eff is this runaround?? What was once $72/year is now going to be $180/year all in. I have never complained about the cost of a vaccine, exam, or other services from my vet but this just seems like a slap to customers so they can profit more off of measly chewable tablets. I can't even throw in the towel and just go physically pick up the Rx to mail it to Chewy because it's a 3 dose max fill which Chewy doesn't even offer.

Does your vet limit your dog's monthly Rx - like is there a real reason I'm not aware of? Is this worth switching vets over?

EDIT/UPDATE: Receptionist said it appears the reasoning is that because my dog is due for his Lepto/Bord vaccines in July is why the doctor only made it a 3-month prescription. The girl was nice and I didn't want to Karen out on her, but I inquired what the checkup had to do with anything when we've never been late on our vaxes, and have always done the 6 month supply - and she said she'd have to leave a note for the doctor about adjusting the prescription. It's possible the doctor didn't know the pricing for the 3-month and 6-month are the same, because the receptionist was surprised to hear it, and was waiming to just discuss or refill the Rx when we met for our annual exam. Hopefully a quick fix, but annoying nonetheless that it's taken beyond 10 days to just get my dog his dang ivermectin tablets lol.

Warning: rant. I watched a couple of youtubers who visited the shows in person and the general consensus was that ADCC put up a good show. I 100% belief ADCC did, especially compared to the last show. Chewy made an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK-QUMRDYX0&t=908s) about the event, but in his mailing-list email complained about being attacked by ""The Cult of Craig"" when saying anything positive about ADCC. It is a legit point and I get where he is coming from.

But I also think that they underestimate how much of the hate is coming from the online Flowgrappling ""experience"": cameras on the wrong mat, commentators commenting on another match, streaming issues, ads during matches (whytf are there ads for a paid service), etc. There is an established history how expensive and shit Flograpping service is. People are fed up with it, but never had an alternative. The main BJJ event of the year(s) was always behind this horrible paywell. Which was also bad for the sport in general, because only hardcore fans would have access to it. The authoritarian arrogance of Mo and the ADCC organisation in general hasn't helped either. And every year it also felt more and more like the Gordon Ryan cult show with even made-up medals specifically for that homeless-people-deserve-to-die-in-the-snow-if-they-dont-work-hard piece of shit.

In the end we as fans felt ripped off, choice-less, bend-over the table and fucked in the ass. You enjoy BJJ? You better suck on this American flag abusing, Trump worshipping, oh-no-my tummy, I-need-special-treatment-and-rules, chest-thumping, taint of a baby-man dickhole like the rest of us and pay the yearly fee if you want to see your favorite grapplers go at it.

And now CJI comes along and makes it about the sport, about the athletes, about charity. It is available for everyone *in the world* to see for free. And while they do that, they make it fun and exiting by causally re-inventing the game in a brilliant matter.

So no shit people have strong feelings about this. I have (obviously).  And yes, we live in a social-media age of polarization and having to choose a camp, a person, a personality, but I think in this case, this is what happens if you treat your customers like shit.

89,Chewy,chewy customer service,1jd5cpd,N/A,2025-03-17,"I feel like buying multiple heavy items as a customer is similar to leaving your table extremely dirty or not tipping at a restaurant Firstly, about the Chewy boxes, water packs, etc.I really don't care about lifting a few heavy boxes. Big deal. It's some extra exercise under your belt. But I still feel it's an uncourteous thing to do regardless on behalf on the consumer, especially considering most people buying these things can easily just pick it up from 2 aisles down at the local Aldi's or whatever, drop it in their cart whenever they get their weekly groceries and take it in themselves. ""Oh but a handicapped person might live there"" Fuck off. I can assure you, a handicap person in a wheelchair is not living at this house with 3 flights of stairs that you need to scale just to reach the front porch. Worst case, they have a caretaker that brings in all this shit anyway. 


I see a lot of the arguments against people who are clearly frustrated with multiple 24-packs of water or Chewy boxes, etc are typically ""it's your job why are you complaining?"" or ""go find another job if you don't like it"" -- but I feel like you can apply that to any other kind of service where you can easily make the workers' lives of that service unnecessarily harder by doing certain things, like leaving a mess at your table where it is convention to clean up after yourself, or refusing to stack the plates such that it's easier for the waiter or waitress to pick them up. No, it's not really illegal to not clean up after yourself. Nobody is going to punish you for it if you don't. The same with tipping. But why make their lives more difficult than it already has to be? Yes, it's the workers responsibility and yes you are paying for the service and giving money to the company that pays their wages, but still.


The other thing is that people absolutely hold the right to complain about their jobs because we are all thrusted into this position not necessarily always by choice; we are born in a debt-based economy with insanely high housing prices and life circumstances that may be less than ideal which lead us to working a dead end job, at least hopefully until something better is found. So the response of ""don't like what you do? Go find something else."" is wild to me because name one person that actually enjoys their job to the point that they would do it for free? You can't. If these people had 10mil dollars in their bank account and the means to doing whatever they want do you think they would be working at the place they are currently? No lmfao. The truth is that the vast majority of people don't even like their job and resent the fact they're going to be working at said job they deeply and secretly dislike for the rest of their waking life but instead of acknowledging that themselves and doing something about it they feel more comfortable not doing anything and then therefore decide they have to shit on other people. It's a ""if I have to put up with it, so do other people"" sense of unjustified unfairness that I think some people have that compels them to treat others with a lack of decency.

Then I hear nothing from tracking other than on a Fed Ex truck. Once again placed on a fedex truck and delivered to the door in a fedex box. The package was originally from Chewy.
 I open the box to find the contents of one of my dry pet foods wet. I call chewy only to find out that My pet food has been contaminated and my pet cleaner is missing. Chewy customer service and forums made that the pet cleaner was placed in my pet food items!
There is no cleaner in the box,the box is in a fedex box instead of chewy. There is no identification that the box was even damaged on my tracking information.
There is no identification that the box was even damaged on tracking  info.
 So, basically someone at Fed Ex repackaged the items, spilled the cleaner inside of my pet food and left the spilled cleaner out and delivered. I mean you can't really re package Something that is spilled out on another item,right?
I am glad that I was able to identify that the pet food was contaminated before my pets becomes sick or died.  How could a company just deliver something contaminated and spilled?

Looking for another card that will compliment the US-BAR. I travel about 6-8 times a year, 50% internationally. Mostly travel to Europe and South America (specifically Peru). Have been flying American Airlines for a few years because PHL is convenient for me but I am open to transferring my alliance to Delta or United (can fly from ACY, ABE, EWR, or BWI).

2. Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite - 15k limit (March 2022) - want to stop using it completely
3. Chase Freedom (OG) - 24k limit (Oct. 2017) - Never use it... but should I? Or should I upgrade it?

94,Chewy,chewy customer service,1iz3hy6,N/A,2025-02-26,"Chewy isn't dependable I have been a faithful Chewy customer for approx 7 years. All 7 of those years have been on autoship. I have 4 large dogs that eat 6 cups a day so it's nice to set it on every 3 weeks and forget about it. Well everything was fine until Dec 2024. For some reason I never got my order. I looked at my app and the order stated shipped 11 days prior. Now I live less than 20 miles from the Chewy plant so I found this odd. I called them and they apologized and stated it was on its way. I had to call back them back a week later to ask where the order was. I was already out of dog food so I had to buy another bag which was almost $60. This was after I paid the $92 for the autoship. Ultimately Chewy credited me $20 to ""cover"" the $60 bag........... after several more days I called a 3rd time asking where the dog food was because the $60 bag was now gone. At that time they stated they didn't know where it was and that they would send me a ""free"" bag of dog food. Well it wasn't free because I never got the bag I paid for. I also got this bag almost 5 weeks late. Fast forward to today 2/26/25. I went to feed my dogs and noticed their food was almost gone. I went to grab the new bag which should have been delivered already and I noticed I didn't receive it. I looked at the app and noticed that they BLOCKED my autoship order. I called then asking why my order was blocked and she would only say they needed to verify the order information. That's strange, Ive been with chewy for almost a decade and not once have they ever needed to verify anything. Actually my order/my credit card and my address haven't changed. I feel this is retaliation for calling in and complaining about the missing dog food. I also feel the service at Chewy has gone down hill the last year. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I'm disappointed that I trusted Chewy to follow through with ensuring I had my dog food (since I have it on autoship) but Chewy failed. Since I can no longer depend on Chewy I had to cancel and find a new company that I can depend on. I will also share my experiences with anyone who will listen.

95,Chewy,chewy customer service,1fj8a56,N/A,2024-09-17,"Marley Spoon Review: A Saga of Chaos, Delays, and Chewy Chicken 

Let me tell you a tale of culinary woe, my friends. My family has been around the block when it comes to meal delivery services. We’re seasoned veterans of the game, having dined with Hello Fresh, Green Chef, Blue Apron—you name it, we’ve tried it. And for the most part, we’ve survived unscathed. But then… along came Marley Spoon. Oh, Marley Spoon, how we had hopes for you. How we were wrong. So, so wrong.

See, we’re a busy family. We’ve got sports, travel, and a whole lot of things that make meal planning essential. Grocery shopping is a dangerous game of spontaneous purchases that we like to avoid at all costs. So when we place an order with a scheduled delivery date, we kind of expect that date to be accurate, you know? Well, our first order never showed up. Nada. Zilch. As we waited for our precious box of ingredients, a delightful little email pinged its way into our inbox. “Your delivery is delayed. Could be 24 hours.” Oh, could it now? Well, thank you, Marley Spoon. So, should we plan for two meals now? Do we need to start Googling “how to make a meal out of stale crackers and sadness”? And what about the meat? Will it arrive cold enough, or is this the food delivery version of Russian roulette with our digestive systems?

Fast forward to the next day—box arrives, late as all hell, just in time to miss dinner. Perfect. At this point, we’re already hangry. The kids are eyeing the cats like we are the illegal immigrants from Hati everyone is up in arms about . So, we call customer service, hoping to salvage what’s left of our sanity and cancel the service. But wait—there’s more! Unlike literally every other service, Marley Spoon decided to throw all the ingredients into the box like a frat house after-party. No separation by meal, no logic, just chaos in cardboard. I spent longer sorting out the contents of this box than I would’ve spent walking aimlessly through the grocery store, wondering why I came in for eggs and left with an inflatable pool.

And just when you think the nightmare’s over, guess what? I noticed they charged me for the next box before I even received the first one. Classic move. So, I call again, and the lovely customer service agent basically says, “Tough luck, dude. The box is already in production.” Oh, is it? Cool, thanks for the heads-up before swiping my card like a thief in the night. Who charges a card before the item even ships? Marley Spoon does, folks. Marley. Spoon.

To add insult to injury, they offered me a whopping $45 credit for the delayed box. Gee, thanks. That’ll definitely make up for the fact that I now have to refuse delivery on the next box and fight my bank to stop payment. But wait, the worst part? The food. Dry, chewy chicken that made me question my life choices. If you’re into bland meals and rubbery meat, congrats—this service is perfect for you.

In conclusion, Marley Spoon is a chaotic mess disguised as a meal delivery service. They’ve got the delivery timing of a sloth on a leisurely stroll and the packaging skills of someone who’s never seen a box before. Do yourself a favor—stick to grocery shopping or literally any other service unless you want to experience food delivery purgatory.",post,12,0.7,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/marleyspoon/comments/1fj8a56/marley_spoon_review_a_saga_of_chaos_delays_and/,Chewy

For me I buy for personal consumption/sharing on the plane. For others, I would reconsider picking up last minute gifts for rellies. 

I think this is my 3rd time where I've gotten defective/spoiled high end brands like Manoa, Tcho and Lonohana at various gift shops. Duty Free, the news stand and I forget what. 

The thing with those types of chocolates is they don't have stabilizers mixed in. So they're pretty temperature sensitive. The outside is covered in white haze if you're lucky. Or less unlucky. One of the brands was so bad the outside of the bar was a solid white haze.  The bar itself crumbled into little pieces and the individual pieces were waxy/chewy. 

I contacted one of the brands customer service with a lot number. That batch was pretty current. So something in the handling at HNL is off enough that the super perishable stuff goes south. Hawaiian Host/Kona are probably okay-ish. They likely have enough stabilizers like paraffin to tolerate whatever time in the sun or warehouse these things are going through en route.

97,Chewy,chewy customer service,1jyulgl,N/A,2025-04-14,"Pet Libro Water Fountain ??????? Hi,
I was on Pet Libro’s site and read this on their warranty section:

“For products purchased directly from an authorized retailer other than the Petlibro official website, such as Amazon and Chewy, the Petlibro customer support team will only provide maintenance service. Contact the above mentioned platform for return and refund service.”

Does everyone who owns Pet Libro know this? It sounds like you can’t get warranty service at all if you buy from Amazon or Chewy? And I see nowhere that lists authorized retailers? One person on Reddit warned not to buy Pet Libro from Amazon saying theirs are junk. 

I found that quote on Pet Libro’s site AFTER ordering a Dock Station listed by Amazon as only having a cosmetic scratch. It arrived yesterday with no filter, no power cord adaptor, no brush, and no manual??!! Now I have to return this disaster.

I decided I would contact Pet Libro to ask questions before re-ordering. I wanted to know the difference in operation between the Dock Station Battery model when plugged in and not using battery motion detecting function, if any, and the Stainless model. Plus, the Dock Station manual online says it has only a 12-month warranty but on Pet Libro’s  website in product description it says it has a 24-month warranty??? 

But there is NO in person phone or chat support. I was forced to email. I did get a quick reply from “April”, who did not answer my questions and then ghosted me when I replied asking the questions yet again.

Anyone have any feedback on Pet Libro? Why do so many sites list this company as the best???? Is there any reliable water fountain, a company with great customer service  AND a great product out there? Can’t seem to find any on Amazon that have an 80% rating and most are in the 60’s approval range. 

Thanks for any help. My cat is ill with crystals and I really need a water fountain to help him recover.

I hate that Chewy uses FedEx for delivery!!  We had so many issues in the past with FedEx not delivering packages.  Thankfully Chewy has excellent customer service and they have always taken care of it.  Then we got a new FedEx driver and she was awesome -- delivered on time and to the right house!  I no longer had to wander our townhouse complex looking for my Chewy box.

I just ordered my dog more of her prescription dog food and it's been delayed three times now.  I hope we don't run out before FedEx finally decides to deliver our Chewy box -- my dog is on a kidney diet, so it's not like I can just run to the pet store and get more.  It's always been delivered a day or two after placing my order, but I still leave a buffer in case it's delayed.  At this point, I'm guessing they lost my dog's food.

Hoping that the job interview I had today actually leads to a job so I can buy an extra bag of food to prepare for FedEx f***-ups.  It's been hard enough lately, and FedEx is just making it harder.  I'm also kind of pissed at Chewy for continuing to use FedEx, and at my vet for not having any prescription foods at their office.

My FedEx driver started leaving all packages by the mailbox next to the busy road. literally on the edge of the road. Doesn't matter if it's raining or not, he still leaves it sitting in the mud without a plastic wrap. Nothing like breaking open a 70 pound chewy box, in the rain, next to a busy road at night because I can't load the whole 70lbs into my Jeep. He is doing the same with my neighbor. I went to the local FedEx store and was told that they're independent contractors so there was nothing he could do. I called FedEx to file a complaint. I got a guy that was actually helpful and took all the information along with tracking numbers. He obviously talked to my driver because it got way, way worse. now he won't deliver at all.  One of my deliveries is a weekly delivery from a food service, Hungryroot. It comes every Wednesday and it's obvious what it is. Well, Wednesday he did not deliver it and tracking showed that it wasn't delivered because ""recipient not available"".  This package does not require signature, never has. Obviously, he wasn't worried about his signature when he was dropping it off on the side of the road.Today, he did the same thing. Tracking shows ""recipient unavailable"".

107,Chewy,chewy refund,1ik8nsd,N/A,2025-02-07,"How the Fedex scam currently works This happened to me recently, thought I'd share what I've inferred.

You buy something on Ali that's crazy cheap, in my case this was a cheap Chinese ham radio that costs \~$90 on Amazon, priced at $42.97 on AE. It's marked ""ships from US"" so you figure you're going to get it in a few days, not a couple of weeks. Tax takes your total to $46.74. Seller marks it shipped in an hour or two and provides a Fedex tracking number. Ali's site will show you the tracking number once they have it, but they won't show you the item's point of origin or its destination. You take the tracking number to [Fedex.com](http://Fedex.com) and notice something weird -- in my case you live in TN but the package is departing CO headed for PA. It also weighs 11 lbs but you know that your item is 2-3 pounds tops.

You freak out and contact Ali support. You allege that the seller might be scamming. Support says yeah, we take scamming very seriously, we definitely don't want any of that, but have you tried contacting the seller yet? You ask what that has to do with tracking showing that the package is departing Colorado heading for Pennsylvania and weighs 11 pounds. They say, ok, you know what? We'll escalate this. Expect an email contact shortly.

An email follow-up shows up about a day later and is obviously boilerplate that just reminds you that if you're not satisfied with your order, you can open a dispute to apply for a refund. Thanks guys.

So you wait it out and the order gets delivered. Fedex's tracking (on Fedex's site) shows that an 11 lb box of Chewy (there's a picture) was delivered to some doorstep in Conshohocken, PA. There's Big Trouble in Little China and they must pay. So you get on AE and open a dispute.

The dispute goes to the seller first, but you don't know this until after you've written out the details of what happened. ""I live in TN but package went from CO to PA.""

Seller makes a counter ""proposal."" They offer to refund you $42.97. So you're out the ""tax"" of $3.77 on a product that never existed.

I'm thinking they just do this in aggregate and lots of people take the offer. I didn't take it and asked AliExpress to step in. We'll see what happens.

108,Chewy,chewy refund,1g0o487,N/A,2024-10-10,"The vast price difference between my pet pharmacy and Chewy I am still determining if this is common, but I just discovered that the vet prescribed Pimobendan tablets for my cat cost $189.83 for 45 tablets (2.5 mg) + $25 shipping. On Chewy, they have Pimobendan for dogs, so I didn't order. Then I found out they were the same thing from the vet pharmacy. The price difference floored me. On Chewy, I could order 100 tablets (2.5 mg) for $172.38 + free shipping. I quickly called the vet to see if I could ask for a refund, and they said no since it's already shipped.

So, I pay $4.21 per tablet at the Vet's office, while Chewy charges only $1.72 per tablet.

This is outrageous! Did any of you see similar patterns with your vet pharmacy? Is there anything I can do about it? Could I file a complaint to consumer protection? Does this count as exploitative pricing?

But I'm not going to lie: the cost of the medication is so expensive.

At least I learned my lesson. From now on, I will always check on Chewy.

Thanks for letting me vent.

**UPDATE:**

Thank you all so much for your comments! I’ve learned a lot from your insights. Here’s a quick summary:

From the vet’s perspective, the price markup is often justified as necessary to keep the business running. I still need to look into this more. Our cat recently had a stay at the emergency hospital for heart failure treatment, and the costs of her previous dental procedures and lab tests for kidney disease have been quite high. While I understand the need to sustain a business, I’m not sure if a markup of over 50% is reasonable. When she was in the ICU, we didn’t have the luxury of time to compare prices with places like Chewy or other sources; we had to go with what the vet prescribed. We should hold them accountable for not exploiting patients in desperate situations.

For non-urgent medications, here are some recommended sources shared in the comments:

    •	Chewy (Use code RXSAVE20 for 20% off your first order)
    
    •	1800PetMeds.com
    
    •	Costco
    
    •	Walmart
    
    •	PetVM
    
    •	Humana (Still need to verify this one)
    
    •	Sometimes, your vet may suggest a human pharmacy for significant savings.

Thanks again for all your help!",post,58,0.87,117,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1g0o487/the_vast_price_difference_between_my_pet_pharmacy/,Chewy

To say I am disappointed in the new version of these after simply loving the old version is an understatement. The old version was a staple, bought and consumed weekly, a nice hearty, flavorful lunch. The old version had a pale green sauce, lots of chicken chunks and a nice, dense, chewy tortilla.

I could tell this wasn't going to be the same as it started microwaving- the offputting vinegar smell was my first clue. The burrito was the same shape and size, but all similarities end there. The sauce is brownish, not green, both liquidy AND weirdly gloppy in texture, and the flavor is wildly different.... and not good. There were four or five chicken pieces, which were tender, and some tiny shreds of chicken. The rest was gloppy, nasty sauce. 

I'm sorry I didn't photograph the inside; I was super hungry so I ate the thing, but never will again for sure. I rarely ask for a refund from Trader Joe's but I am going to this time.

My cat's been having some dental pain so I switched her to just wet food (she saw the vet this morning) and she was loving the Weruva, especially Kitty Gone Wild. I ordered the 10-oz cans from Chewy. On Saturday night, she wouldn't eat her food but kept standing by her bowl. I checked it and there was a squishy larva of some sort in her food. The photo was after I stirred the food around to see if there were bones or something else she wanted me to remove.

I filled out their contact form on Saturday evening and still haven't heard anything as of Monday afternoon. I saved the can and the bug. I tried contacting them today but they conveniently close at 1:30 my time.

Chewy was amazing. They fully refunded my order and asked me to dispose of the case of food and donate the other Weruva items in my order.

122,Chewy,chewy refund,1kgozgq,N/A,2025-05-07,"Honest Kitchen points loss from expiration date change Hello.  This is a note for anyone buying Honest Kitchen dog food directly from their website [https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/) \- Check your points balance for expiration around 4/2025 after only one year due to a change in their terms, then request they be refunded because the terms didn't update until after 4/20/25.

For years, Honest Kitchen has run a reward system of earning points for purchases on their site, redeemable for discounts on future purchases.  Points always expired two years after being earned.  However, on 4/17/25, I discovered that some of my points had recently expired after only one year.  This also happened to my mother's and sister's accounts.  On 4/20/25, I captured PDFs of their rewards overview and terms pages showing that they should expire in two years.

Late in April, I contacted support about the premature expiration and they refunded the lost points.  At about that same time, Honest Kitchen updated their website with a slight redesign, some revised pages... and new rewards terms.  They state that points now expire within one year, they can change the terms at any time, they don't have to notify you, and you are responsible for keeping track of the rewards terms.  See the terms here - [https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/2024-rewards-terms-and-conditions](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/2024-rewards-terms-and-conditions)

I recommend that anyone with points check their rewards history at [https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/my-rewards](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/pages/my-rewards)  It may show points expiring during early April, before the new terms.  It's tough to tell which points those were because you'll have spent the oldest points while earning more.  I copied the history into Excel and checked the running sum to confirm.  Do your best to check, but ultimately, unspent points earned over one year ago got expired.

If your points expired after one year before 4/20/25, contact support and ask for them to be refunded because their new one year expiration date was not public at that point.  When you get them back, spend them right away before any more expire.

Then buy Honest Kitchen at Chewy because their sales are vastly better than buying from Honest Kitchen directly.",post,0,0.33,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogFood/comments/1kgozgq/honest_kitchen_points_loss_from_expiration_date/,Chewy

Age: 26

Job: Compliance Manager

Salary: 95,000 (plus 6000-8000 in bonuses and other compensation)

* I do have a secondary income stemming from real estate that is to the tune of $18000 annually, however it is rare that the money is used for personal spending at this point. 

Location: Arlington Virginia

 

**~Section One: Assets and Debt~**

**Retirement Balance:** Currently I am under the threshold of tenure at this company to be able to have any sort of match in my 401k, in its place I am currently saving 6% post tax (what will be my contribution when I hit tenure) and putting $200 of it in my Roth IRA monthly and the rest going into a HYSA while I am getting my bearings after the move I will move the rest into my Roth at the end of the year. Current Retirement balance between rollover accounts and my Roth is approximately **$22k**.

**Equity:** I own a small split-level house in a college town that I lived in post grad for three years. I don’t keep perfect track of equity because I have added a bathroom to the unit that isn’t measured in the online assessments but Zillow says it’s worth $255k so based on that I have **$125k** in equity.

**Savings Account Balance:** **About $4,500**, I am riding a lot lower than I normally have as I have just gotten back to work after a 10 week stint of unemployment.

**Checking Account Balance:** **$3265.** I try to move as much money as I can to my HYSA to grow while still covering my normal bills

**Credit card debt:** None, I have 4 credit cards (one being my first card I keep open for length of credit history) and pay them off in full each month.

**Mortgage Debt:** I owe **\~125k** on the home mentioned above. I bought in 2020 at an extremely low interest rate so I do not make any extra payments as the money earns more in even my HYSA than paying the debt off early will at this point in time.

**Student Loan Debt:** No debt, 90% of my degree was covered between parental help and scholarships. The remaining 10% I “owed” to my parents and paid it off in the first year of post grad. I fortunately went to the least expensive instate school (Go Hokies) and graduated a semester early. If I had made other choices, my parents made it clear they only could help so much (and I am grateful that they did what they did)

**Vehicle Loan Debt:** My beater died last year so I bought a 2024 Kia Seltos, which I owe **$20k** on. I have been throwing as much money as I can at the loan and hope to have it paid off in half the lifetime of the loan. 

**~Section Two: Income~**

**Income Progression:** My first job ever was working for a local fast food joint in high school, bringing in a whopping $7.25/ hour. Through college I worked lab jobs for my school for $10/hour. My first ""big girl"" job post college was a field compliance supervisor role in agriculture (what my degree is in) for $50k in 2020. From there I went from field compliance to facility compliance, running food safety programs, where my salary climbed to $57k to 85k last year, where I fully burnt out of Agriculture and applied to this current job which is a  more ""standard"" corporate job in the wellness industry.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** I bring home almost exactly **$6,000** monthly. My employer covers all my healthcare premiums, HSAs, and disability insurances. I withhold $50 a month pretax for my metro card.

**Passive Monthly Income**
I currently lease the house out for **$1550** a month, which is about 8% below market rate at the time of this diary. Between mortgage, escrow, and utilities I usually come out with **$600** monthly that is saved for repairs. I have firm beliefs about the responsibilities of owning rental properties and renting out below market while still cash flowing is central to that belief. If there is ever a point, I cannot lease this property under market rate and still cash flow I will sell. 

Additionally, I tend to do $200-300 worth of gig work, however I don’t count on that money in my budget, as it is very inconsistent.

**Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?:**

Yes, there was definitely an expectation to continue education. For a while my parents talked about me doing community college as my anxieties around school were sky high my junior and senior years. However, their goal was a 4 year institution, which I ended up going to.

**Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent/guardian(s) educate you about finances?:**

Yes, they did. Both of my parents come from lower income homes (and were not super wealthy when I was born) so the conversations about budgeting, investing, and how to save were constant conversations, which in turn lowered the pressure that I experienced regarding it.

**Did you worry about money growing up?:**

Yes, because I was an anxious child. But our needs and many wants were met, I had no real reason to be worrying.

**Do you worry about money now?:**

Yes, because of anxiety. But I am a lot more conscious of my worries

**At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?:**

After I finished undergrad, I was fully responsible (though I have stayed on my parents phone plan and may never get off of it). I absolutely have a safety net with my parents, I became dependent for about 8 weeks after I quit my job this yet and came home to lick my wounds and find my new job. I paid my own food and bills, but they let me live at home for free until I moved into the city.

**Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?:**

Yes, as I said above I do have a home that I receive rental income for.

**~Section Three: Expenses~**

**Rent:** **$2800/month** (including all utilities, parking, pet fees, etc to have a 1 bedroom apartment in Arlington a 5 minute walk from my office. I love the building and its proximity to my work as well as a metro station, it is very expensive and I have had to alter my budget to fit this expense, but considering the other units I was looking at were $2400 without utilities a 30 minute metro commute from the office, I felt like I did ok. I considered roommates, however with having a dog it was worth the piece of mind.

**Donations:** I donate approximately **$100/month** to various causes: political, social, and religious. In this role with my new salary I plan to increase my donations however I am not sure by how much yet.

**Utilities:** Included in rent number, see above. There is a clause in the lease regarding gas usage if it exceeds a certain number, however we have electric heat and the gas is only for the stove and none of the other tenants I’ve met have ever paid extra.

**Cellphone:** I stay on my family’s plan as we have stayed grandfathered in on a sweet deal for over a decade now. In exchange I pay for the Peloton account **$44/month**, we just about break even.

**Subscriptions:** Hulu+ ($**3/month**—a great deal from Black Friday), YNAB ($109 annually, that comes out to **$9/month**), Credit Card Fees ($99 & $95, which together are **$16/month**, and Google Storage (19.99 annually, **$1.67/month**)

Additional expenses are Renters Insurance ($131 annually, **$11/month**), Car Insurance ($2100 annually, **$175/month**), and Personal Property Taxes (Estimated at $600 biannually, **$100/month**)

**~Day One: Sunday~**

6:00am – It’s moving day! I am so excited I cannot stay in bed a second longer. I’m up and begin my morning routine and meds and pack up the bathroom at my parent’s house that I have been staying in during my employment and the first 60 days at the new job. I make myself a cup of coffee and eat a banana but I’m a bit nervous so I just try to get it down (little did I know).

8:00am – I am waiting at the U-Haul place with my father, who has graciously decided to help me move in. (This is where the drama begins my friends). I get notified after 15 minutes that my U-Haul in unavailable due to unforeseen issues and that we need to drive across town to another location to pick up a slightly different truck.

10:00am – The next place isn’t open when we get there, so we wait and wait and wait and wait with a crowd of other hopeful movers. Alas, an hour passes and while the “on call” number picked up, they basically told us to wait because the employee “was coming” – ok, sure buddy, but your shop was supposed to be open at 9am when we got here. Window for key pick up is by 3:00pm and it’s a 90+ minute drive away.

10:30am – We have given up on Uhaul in desperate hopes of making my move in window. We go to the Home Depot and rent the largest box truck I’ve ever seen. It’s a lot more expensive than U-Haul but at this point I don’t care. **$200 + $100 deposit**

11:00am – We get all the boxes, mattress, and furniture loaded up, strapped down and we hit the road—my dad behind the wheel of the box truck, me speeding ahead with my car desperately trying to make the window to pick up my keys.

1:30pm – I make it with 30 minutes to spare, pick up the keys, and enter my unit for the first time. With the spare seconds before my dad shows up I start making a list of potential dinner places to pick up from later tonight—knowing him he will want Cava, but I make a short list of other options.

5:00pm – We start using the freight elevator and unloading. I’ve moved a fair amount in the last 5 years and we manage to get most everything through the move in motions. I order Cava for my dad and I (**$30.14**) as he moves the truck out of the loading bay and go walk the two blocks to Target to buy laundry detergent, sponges, and cleaner for my mop vacuum - **$24.85** and then pick up our bowls. We chat about the progress of the apartment, and he shares that he doesn’t have the right tool to mount the television and my headboard with him, I figure I will hire a Task Rabbit to knock both tasks out at the beginning of the week.

7:00pm – We say our goodbyes and he preps for his 90 minute drive home. Not even 10 minutes goes by and I get a call -- he has accidentally hit a mailbox with the truck. (I told you this was a day). I drive to his location and verify that he's ok and the truck is ok. I ring the doorbell and nobody is home, so I leave a note with my contact information to offer to pay for the repairs and send my dad back on his way.

8:00pm - I send a text to a friend in the area to see if she wants to have celebratory move-in drinks—no response. So I head back upstairs to continue the dish washing and laundry in order to get ready for bed. 

10:00pm – I’m exhausted and fall asleep on the made bed. 

Daily Total: **$254.99 + $100 deposit**

**~Day Two: Monday~**

7:00am – My boss messages me and lets me know she’s under the weather and will be staying remote for the remainder of the week and encourages me to go remote for the day to get through unpacking – score! Morning routine and meds and I’m ready for the day.

7:30am – I have ZERO groceries minus some produce from my parents garden; so I walk back to the target to pick up coffee for my cold brew pitcher, creamer, Gatorade, an energy drink and a shower liner - **$32.97**. On my walk home I scan through Task Rabbit and find some with an ok hourly rate, fabulous reviews, and most importantly availability today. I send him some pictures of what I have needing to be hung and he agrees to come after 1pm. I prep the cold brew and crack the energy drink while I hop online to sort through the emails I received while on PTO last week.

11:00am – Dad lets me know the updated cost for the rental truck, the deposit is refunded, but it was **$71.34** extra for the mileage and gas going onto the card I left on file. Sigh. But as I open my credit card app, I see that my complaint to UHaul processed and I received **$50** for the “inconvenience”. At least something good came out of that nightmare. I start to make a list of needed groceries as I snack on cherry tomatoes from the garden. I will miss having the fresh veg in the summer, but it was time for me to move out, I love my parents to the ends of the earth, but we get along best when I am not sleeping two rooms away.

12:00am – I continue working on projects and open my  Hinge to chat with some people. I ended a relationship end of May/ beginning of June and my sister convinced me over last week that I need to try to go on dates this month just to try to get back out there. A match she picked for me asks if we can grab tacos at a restaurant that’s not far from my apartment, I agree and set the time. Task Rabbiter sends me a text stating his job before mine finished early and asked if he could come sooner, I agree and tell him my unit number so I can buzz him in.

2:00pm – Task Rabbit guy hangs headboard and TV in less than an hour. It’s perfect and with tip the whole endeavor costs me **$116.40**. This is my first time living in a large enough metro area that Task Rabbit is available to me and for the time it would have taken my dad and I, even if he had the tools, it was well worth the spend. After he leaves I walk to the grocery store around the corner and spend **$73.17** on basic seasonings, onions, bacon, eggs, tortillas, avocado and hot sauce. I’ve been on a breakfast taco kick and it’s going to continue at the new place. I hop back online and sign on for an optional skills training and listen in while I put away dishes and fold laundry. After having been in person 6 days a week, the flexibility that comes with this role is second to none.

5:30pm – I submit my final document to my boss’s inbox and hop in the shower to get ready for the date. I’m nervous, I have not been a huge online dating fan over the years, but I am hoping that this is a good way to expand my circle. I have some friends in the district and have joined clubs since starting the new job, but dating adds a whole new spice to the mix. I put on a cute dress, do a teeny bit of makeup, and try to style my hair, but end up just brushing it straight. Start the walk to the restaurant.

8:30pm – Date is super nice! We speak about work and how we ended up in DC, neither of us work in consulting or politics, which is a refreshing realization. The tacos are disappointing and while the conversation flows well, I opt to offer to go Dutch -- **$22.06**. He offers to go on a post dinner walk around since we are so close to the river, I agree and we walk for a bit, ending at his car. We say our goodbyes and I walk the long way around to my apartment building, never can be too careful.

9:00pm – I put away some more laundry and break down more boxes from the move until I can’t keep my eyes open. Brush teeth, wash face, collapse.

Daily Total: **$622.63 - $50 U Haul credit**

**~Day Three – Tuesday~**

7:00am – Today is going to be an in-office day, despite nobody from my team being in today. I hustle around to make a bit of coffee and two breakfast tacos. Yum! Quick makeup routine and meds and I’m ready to go out the door!

8:30am – The short walk to work is awesome. I prefer working earlier vs later so I am one of the first people in the building. I settle in with a banana from the kitchen and get to working, it’s going to be a slog of meetings and I am hoping to get out of the office before 4 to try and do some grocery shopping at somewhere cheaper than the fancy pants grocer near my apartment.

12:00pm – I have a lunch of yogurt and granola from the shared kitchen and chat with some coworkers. My office skews young and female, which is awesome to work with so many intelligent people who are like me. I come from a very conservative and male dominated field having a team of strong, smart ladies in all facets of our company really makes the work feel so empowering. While we are talking I get a notification that my Chewy autoship has charged my card - **$104.28**. In the autoship I have my dog’s kibble, probiotic and treats that are shared with my parent’s dog. They are keeping her for my first two weeks so that I can get settled without worrying about her.

4:00pm – Freedom! Off to the highlight of my day—H Mart and Trader Joes. I make the tedious drive out of the main city to do the big shop for things like chili oil, rice, fish sauce, some veg, and some sushi as a treat at Hmart **($96.02)** and wine, berries, seasonings, frozen soup dumplings and some canned tuna at TJs **($106.39)**. Having a very fresh start at this apartment is something I’ve never really done and it’s been fun realizing what my go-to seasoning have been.

6:00pm – Groceries have been put away, the treat of sushi has been consumed, and now I continue the dreaded unpacking process. Laundry, organizing, and making lists fills my evening. Another match on Hinge tells me about country line dancing on Wednesdays and I get excited. Having just moved here from South Carolina, I thought I would miss my weekly two step, swing, and line dancing. I double check to make sure I brought my boots and agree to go for tomorrow.

10:00pm – The living room and kitchen look clean and not freshly moved in. Nightly routine again and I head to sleep.

Daily Total: **$306.69**

**~Day Four: Wednesday~**

8:00am – Accidentally slept in and dart around the place to get ready. Routine and meds are lightning fast and I race to get in the office. We have a vendor meeting at 10 that I need to prepare for. I skip coffee at home and opt into some of the espresso from our office machine. It’s payday, which always feels nice, but since I use You Need A Budget, the payday excitement is even better – love filling my categories!

10:00am – The vendors are here and they bring samples of their technology for all of our team to trial. They give a good shpiel but they are not large enough to scale for our needs right now, as much as I wish we could. After they leave I continue working on projects for the week.

1:00pm – I worked through my normal lunch time and I am starving, but I am taking a workout class in a couple hours so I just grab a banana and peanut butter from the kitchen. I love that we have food options, but I definitely end up snacking instead of eating lunch often.

3:00pm – It’s class time! A perk of this job is we get free workout classes at a lot of major brands in the area. I have historically not loved group fitness, but with it being free it seems like a loss to not do it at least weekly. I hop on the Metro and realize that I will be short on my ride home (**$5**). I try to only use my pretax metro money, but you gotta get it done! Make it to the 3:20 Solidcore class and sweat my butt off!

4:30pm – I ride the metro back with the prepaid credit I paid early and make myself a rice bowl with gochujang, arugula, and tuna after a quick shower. I clip my hair up with some volumizing mousse to try and prevent the fall of my straight hair when I head out to dance tonight.

8:00pm – Open dance starts at 9pm, so Hinge date and I meet at the metro station and grab a beer at a nearby bar as we wait. We can hear the music from the dance hall from the patio and talk about dancing and what our favorite artists are. 

9:00pm – The lesson was wrapping up as we walked in and I immediately felt at home. I love to dance and love the mix of partner and line dancing that country nights offer. Hinge Date and I dance together and also with other leads and follows – he is way more advanced than me and I enjoy watching him do the advanced flips and dips. However, he is not a line dancer so when those songs come on it was even more fun watching him try to keep up with the pace. 

11:30pm – This late on a school night? He and I are heading opposite directions, but he insists on sending me some money for an uber vs riding the metro home (**$15**). I call the uber and with tip it’s exactly $15. Perfect. We wait together for my ride and get a goodbye kiss. \*swoon\* I am so glad that tomorrow is a remote day – I get home quickly rinse off, do my routine and am asleep before my head hits the pillow.

Daily Total: **$5**

**~Day Five: Thursday~**

8:00am – Overslept again, so sore between class and dancing last night. I hop in the shower to loosen my muscles and wake myself up. I slink to the couch with a coffee to start producing reports with the hopes of using my lunch hour for a nap.

12:00pm – After getting off a quick call with the boss, I fry up some tomatoes from the garden with two eggs and some of yesterdays rice. Some quick eats and then I set my timer for a 35 minute nap. It was much needed and with a quick walk around in the warm sun, I’m feeling a lot better. As I walk around I realize that I have an Instacart credit deal on my card so I put in a small order from Harris Teeter to use it up. Manage to get $75 worth of groceries for **$51.41** including tip. I don’t often use Instacart, but it was great to have some fresh veg to use in tonight’s dinner.

5:00pm – After logging off, I have some more eggs, rice and now spinach and onions for dinner, along with blueberries and raspberries. Plus some Advil. I haven’t danced like I did last night in ages and it feels good to be a bit sore. I settle in and watch Criminal Minds and end up falling asleep on the couch. 

9:00pm – I’m awake and do my evening routine and then spend a ½ hour closing shop, cleaning counters, washing dishes, etc. Crawl into bed and spend too much time scrolling Reddit, thinking about writing this diary.

Daily Total: **$51.41**

**~Day Six: Friday~**

6:30am – Waking up before my alarm after all that sleep is glorious. I’m still majorly sore so I lay in bed and realize that the biggest con of the apartment is no overhead fan. I grab my phone, do a bit of research and pull the trigger on a fan from Amazon, along with some descaling solution for my Nespresso, coffee pods, and an avocado container for **$133.06**.

9:00am – Morning routine, meds and a big cup of coffee. Log in and review email as I rewatch the episode of Criminal Minds I fell asleep to. My boss is off today so a lot of my submissions from yesterday have not been reviewed, leaving me in a bit of a holding pattern. Hinge guy from Monday sends me a message stating he didn’t think we were a fit (sad, but probably true) and Hinge guy from dancing sent me his number, yay! I send him a text and he immediately asks if I have plans this weekend. Nope I don’t, but I’d like to!

12:00pm – Lunch is leftovers and a bunch of blueberries. Nothing exciting, but I can see the end in sight for the day. I work through lunch to get the handful over last minute ticket items wrapped up.

3:00pm – Done for the day! A friend of mine messages me and asks if she can come see the new apartment—Absolutely! She now only lives a 10 minute drive away for the first time since we have been in college—yay! She brings over a bottle of wine and we spend the next 4 hours catching up, drinking the bottle she brought (then the bottle I brought) talking about her upcoming bridal shower, my date from Wednesday and everything in-between.

8:00pm – She offers to buy some food at the deli next door so we run and grab subs and eat. It’s been so good to catch up, I offer to let her crash at my place for the night and she accepts.

Daily Total: **$133.06**

**Day Seven: Saturday**

9:00am – Friend and I both sleep in, but as soon as we’re up coffee in our systems, she asks if I want to run Roosevelt Island with her. She had clothes in her car, so we get changed and run the 5k loop from my apartment to the memorial, and back. Sweating out all the wine while we do it, it reminds me of how glad I am to have made this move. It was scary quitting my job and moving home, but I missed my people.

10:00am – Friend does a quick rinse and heads back to her and her fiancé’s apartment. After my shower I call my mom, which becomes a Facetime check in on my pup. I’ve missed having her around, but I also totally recognize that this week would have been hard on her. My mom and I are close, we could talk for hours when we don’t live together.

12:00pm – Make myself a pot of mac and cheese and text with Hinge guy about our plans. He has made dinner reservations near the water so that we can go for a walk after dinner. Second dates make me FAR more nervous than first dates, so I quickly try to make myself busy cleaning the apartment and not thinking about my own feelings. I get an text alert that my card has been charged for me Nurx prescription for acne - **$18.17**

3:00pm – Take a quick nap, another shower and start picking out what I’m going to wear. I take my time getting ready, hoping it calms my nerves. It doesn’t so I pour the last glass from the bottle my friend and I shared last night and sip it as I finish curling my hair. Cute dress on, heels, and feeling a lot better. I get the message that he is on his way to pick me up and I head down to the entry to meet him. 

5:30pm – Dinner is amazing, and it is so nice to be able to take our time talking about each other vs the conversational prep for dancing. The dinner goes for hours without dropping a minutes pace. We walk to the water and continue our chats, taking in the skyline. Neither one of us is from here so it’s nice to appreciate it with someone who understands how hard the move can be. 

8:30pm – We end up walking past an ice cream shop and I offer to cover a dessert**$21.09**. Ice cream being that expensive hurts my brain, but the ice cream is absolutely delicious. We end the night driving me home with a quick kiss after he walks me to the front of my apartment. I am not usually a hopeless romantic, but it's wild how good dates can make you feel like you're some character out of a movie.

11:00pm - Night time routine and gushing to my friend from this morning about the date. I lay in bed feeling like I'm 15--giddy over a first crush, which is a new feeling for me. But eventually I doze off.

Daily Total: **$36.29**

Recap:

Transport: $5

Food + Drink: $433.11

Home+ Health & Misc: $691.27

This started as the most unusual type of spending with setting up the new apartment and needing to get basic groceries. But it ended closer to what I would consider my \*typical\* spend is. I have heard from the mailbox owner, it ended up being much cheaper than I thought it would be -- $150, which I paid because I didn't need to add the guilt to my dad for.

128,Chewy,chewy refund,1glv7so,N/A,2024-11-07,"Sudden GI upset on Hill’s z/d cans Has anyone experienced or heard of any issues with this food recently? 
My dog has been on z/d cans for a few months which immediately solved her GI issues and has had no relapses since. This week she suddenly has loose stools with a lot of mucus and I’m waiting to hear back from our vet about it. In the meantime I saw a very recent Chewy review of the can food suddenly making their dog ill with very bad liver and pancreatic labs. Hoping this isn’t a future recall. 

Update: Here's some helpful info from a very busy day trying to figure out what's making my girl sick. 

Bought new canned z/d food: The cans I had were the 5.5oz cans from Chewy. I bought the 13oz cans from Petco last night to have something to feed her and saw the food inside looked so different from the 5.5oz cans: it was a different (more normal) color, no bubbly consistency, no weird dark specks of what could be chicken skin or something. No longer feeding her the old cans. 

Vet: did a stool sample, negative for Giardia and they didn't see anything under the microscope, but sending it off for further testing for more parasites. Also going back in for an exam and likely labs tomorrow. 

Called Hill's: they did a thorough review with me about the canned food I had, medical history, feeding habits, etc. I'm sending them more photos of the difference in how the food looked in the old cans from Chewy and the new cans from Petco. They also said they want to send me coupons. 

Called Chewy: Per advice from Hill's, called Chewy to alert them about the issue. They instructed I send back what I had left of the 24 pack and they will refund me for the entire pack. They also advised that if I ever get dented cans in future shipments, they will refund/exchange the dented ones",post,6,1,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogFood/comments/1glv7so/sudden_gi_upset_on_hills_zd_cans/,Chewy
129,Chewy,chewy refund,1jv0fl1,N/A,2025-04-09,"I never got my order and the Amazon seller is refusing to refund me. I need some help I ordered something on Amazon waited over a month for it to show up and it never did. I ended up getting a similar item used so I no longer needed this one so I tried to get a refund. Amazon had me message the seller who claimed it was delivered. I asked them to verify the address which they had the right address so I went back to double check my camera thinking ""ok maybe someone picked it up off my porch."" (I have never in the 8+ years of living here ever had someone take a package off my porch before but you know just to be sure.) I checked the exact time and date that they claimed it was delivered and nothing. I sent them a couple of clips showing that the package wasn't delivered there wasn't even any sign of the truck. They then claimed that the package was left at the outskirts of my home. I honestly don't believe this as I have never had a package left anywhere other than my porch. Also all my mail is delivered to my door because my mailbox is at my door. So it's unlikely they would place it somewhere else. I have only ever had this happen 1 other time over 5 years ago with an order from chewy which chewy immediately sent me another one. So I'm really not sure what to do at this point. I don't know what else I could do. I don't want to just forget about it because it was quite a bit of money to spend on something that I never even got. I have been chatting with them going on 3 days now and it's very clear they have no intention of giving me a refund. So what do I do? Amazon said that if I didn't hear back from them in 2 days they would give me an ""A to Z refund"" but I did here back from them they were just not helpful. Will Amazon still give me the refund? 

For some more insight. I order off Amazon all the time as I live an hr away from all big stores so it's better to order stuff online and have it delivered. At the same time I ordered this item I also ordered 15 other items. I received all other items. I have also placed 2 other orders since and have received those items as well. This is the only item I did not receive. Amazon said the package was lost and when I checked the tracking number, there is actually 2 orders with the same tracking number. 

Any advice is much appreciated as I'm tired of fighting with them. ",post,1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jv0fl1/i_never_got_my_order_and_the_amazon_seller_is/,Chewy

He was only in the shelter for a couple of days and nothing is known about his life pre-shelter as he was “found” with three of his siblings and surrendered.

I slowly introduced him to Purina ONE healthy kitten chicken and salmon pate and all seemed well. I leave dry food out for him during the day, and while he will occasionally eat it if I put him in front of it, he never really seems to seek it out or finish it.

Because there is only one flavor of the Purina, and in hopes of preventing a picky eater, I tried introducing a Nulo all life stages minced wet food by mixing it with the Purina as well as on its own and that was a complete bust even after trying three flavors. And now ever since, he’ll sniff the Purina, maybe lick it once, try to burry it and walk away. I’m able to get him to eat some by topping it with a Churu lickable or no salt added in water sardines but trying to limit this so as to not set a precedent. I warm the food, add water, etc. 

Did I create my own picky eater? Any suggestions on how to get him to eat the Purina?

136,Chewy,chewy refund,1j3o6pt,N/A,2025-03-04,"I think something fishy is going on - please advice :( I'm feeling really frustrated, trying to advocate for myself as a patient but I don't know how to proceed and would appreciate any guidance. I have had my Invisalign since May of 2024, I was only supposed to be doing 6 months to correct the issues I had. I had one set of trays that fit poorly I had to get a warranty sent in for new trays so I was delayed until the end of November/ beginning of dec.

When November rolled around, I went in and was told I would need a set of refinements (to be expected). As it was around Christmas time I was told that it was would take a month approximately for the new trays to come in (annoying yes but oh well it was Christmas). 

  
My first set of refinement trays came in and were so ill-fitting they didnt even click into my attachements,  the dentist agreed that they weren't fitting properly and we should resend in for another warranty claim. Sent in for another set of refinement trays under a warranty claim and once again when they arrived there were large gaps between my teeth and the trays. We decided to send in again (third times the charm right?) wrong. 

When the third set came in, we are now 4 months delayed in my process, Invisalign apparently suggested they take off the attachments and put on new ones, which they did and when we went to get the new trays in they were a much better fit, but still not fit to my teeth accordingly. 

  
The dentist said they were going to communicate with Invisalign to see why they weren't fitting properly. Appparently, after communicating with Invisalign, the dentist was told that there were ""dimples/ pressure points"" that were added into the treatment - to note: there are no visual dimples on my aligners, and its hard to understand how it could be a pressure point when its the issue is that they are not fitting as there's gaps between where the teeth make contact and the aligners that no amount of chewy work would fix.

Over the last several months we keep getting trays where every can that we open, the food is gray, looks like a patty, and is pulled away from the edges of the can. It has a rancid smell, so we keep having to report it and toss it. This has happened for 8 separate orders.

When I moved in, I had a man try to come into my house, and I found out later from a neighbor that it was apparently the previous tenants ex boyfriend. A few months after that, a sheriff was at my door asking if the previous tenant still lived in my apartment, and he proceeded to show me the warrant out for their arrest. Clearly, not a decent person. 

Well, the other day i received not 1, not 2, not 3, BUT 4 Chewy packages. Clearly it is some kind of pet food or kitty litter (big bags of something that are heavy), and I believe pet meds (one of the boxes says “simparica trio”). Now, I do have a dog, so I could possibly benefit by opening these boxes but I’m trying to be respectful if this person ends up coming by to pick up these items. However, they are huge, and they take up my front doorway (additional context — I live in a sort of walk up, so not wasting my energy lugging these upstairs when I’d rather just leave them at the door if this said person comes by). Plus, I’m just super curious to bust into them. If anything, I would end up donating this stuff to a shelter if I had no use for it, rather than just throw it away. I also see no point in calling FedEx because this was not my problem to begin with, and I feel as though that’s just an inconvenience for me and the least this person can do is simply get refunded or take the loss for not updating their shipping address.

144,Chewy,chewy refund,1em549p,N/A,2024-08-07,"Beware of Vetster: Hidden Fees, Limited Medications, and Price Gouging I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Vetster, an online vet service. The issues I encountered highlight some serious concerns regarding their anti-competition practices and price gouging, which I feel compelled to share with others considering their services.

**Hidden Fees and Deceptive Pricing**
I scheduled a vet visit that was advertised at $90. However, after various hidden fees were added, the final cost shot up to $120. This significant increase was not disclosed upfront, making the advertised price misleading.

**Limited Medication Options**
Another major issue is the limited range of medications that Vetster's vets can prescribe. This crucial information is not disclosed before the consultation, leading to further frustration when you realize that your pet's needs may not be fully met.

**Price Gouging with VetsterRX**
Vetster runs their own pharmacy service, VetsterRX, and the prices are exorbitant. They not only charge high prices for medications but also add a staggering $19 in service fees on top of shipping costs. This feels like blatant price gouging, especially considering the alternative options available.

**Refusal to Work with Chewy**
While Vetster offers to send prescriptions to outside pharmacies, they refuse to work with Chewy. This is particularly frustrating because medications through Chewy would be 70% cheaper. Their refusal to cooperate with a more affordable pharmacy seems like an intentional move to force customers to use VetsterRX, further highlighting their anti-competitive practices.

**Lack of Transparency and No Refund Policy**
None of these issues are advertised upfront. They only come to light after you’ve paid for the vet visit, which is incredibly deceptive. To make matters worse, when I reached out to Vetster to address these concerns, they refused to provide a refund despite their misleading pricing and service agreements.

In summary, Vetster's hidden fees, limited medication options, price gouging, and lack of transparency make them a service I cannot recommend. Their refusal to work with cheaper pharmacies and lack of a refund policy only adds to the frustration. I hope this review helps others avoid the same pitfalls I encountered",post,17,0.91,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1em549p/beware_of_vetster_hidden_fees_limited_medications/,Chewy
145,Chewy,chewy refund,1fxwmw7,N/A,2024-10-06,"What % of medication upcharge is normal at the vet? Hi all! 

I just took my cat to the vet for emergency services for the first time - the total cost was $280. I thought it was reasonable ($95 for the visit, $100 for two eye test strips, and another $80 for two eyedrops)

Specifically, they charged me $45.11 for one bottle of Ofloxacin Opthalmic Solution, and $36.75 for one Neo-Poly-Dex Opthalmic Suspension 

I paid on site because it was my first time taking my cat to the vet outside of a physical exam, and I felt very anxious about his health so I didn't ask a lot of questions about the price. 

But now that I've calmed down about my cat and I'm looking up the prices on chewy for these eyedrops, I can't believe how much cheaper they are?!!!

Chewy is selling the exact same Ofloxacin Opthalmic Solution for $10.99, and the Neo-Poly-Dex Opthalmic Suspension for $13.99!!! I would understand if they upcharged me slightly - maybe $20 and $25 respectively I would have been able to live with, but a 400% and 250% upcharge seems ridiculous and predatory. 

Is this normal?? Is there anything I can do? I've already opened up the eyedrop solutions and given it to my cat so I can't exactly go and ask for a return and refund. ",post,0,0.5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1fxwmw7/what_of_medication_upcharge_is_normal_at_the_vet/,Chewy
146,Chewy,chewy refund,1h99rfh,N/A,2024-12-07,"The Pervasive Problem of Dented Pet Food *(tl;dr: Pet food stores are consistently sending damaged goods and fail to do anything to actually solve the problem. Something needs to be done, but I don't know what.)*

If you order canned food to be shipped to you, you know what I'm talking about. Every order, almost without fail, comes with at least a few dented cans—and in some orders, nearly all the cans are wrecked. It's especially bad when the box is being shipped from an individual Petsmart/Petco retail store, and especially especially bad when said box is being shipped via FedEx. Chewy isn't without blame either, but in my experience they at least put a little more effort into trying to get cans to you undamaged.

**They all offer replacements or refunds if you contact them, so what's the big deal?**

(1) My first concern would be for the consumers who receive these damaged cans and say, ""oh, they're just a \*little\* dented,"" and proceed to feed the food to their animals thinking nothing is really wrong. Sometimes that's true: depending on where the dents are, if they're relatively small they usually aren't a problem. But that ""depending on where the dents are"" is really important here. Cases when the can is unsafe to use, regardless of size/extent of damage:

* If the dents are on any seams (top, bottom, or side) or near the lid's seal
* If the dents have sharp edges or if there are two dents that meet at a point
* If the lid is bulging or pops when pressed
* If the can is heavily rusted (light surface rust is usually fine; rust *inside* the can is never fine)

If these companies are shipping out damaged cans to nearly every customer that orders them, there are probably a lot of people using unsafe products without realizing it. That's a big problem!

(2) My second concern is the additional burden placed on the consumer to remedy the problem when they receive defective product. Granted, the three companies named *do* make it fairly easy to get a refund or replacements, but there is still a burden there. It requires additional effort by the customer to make the contact and sometimes the companies require proof such as photos. If they opt for a refund, the customer then has to wait a few business days for their refund to process before they have access to those funds. If they want replacements, they then have to wait the additional time for replacements to be sent (and hope that the replacement shipment won't also come damaged), or they have to use their own time and resources to go to a retail location to exchange the damaged goods (IF that location has the same food in stock).

Considering the large scale of the problem, that's a pretty big collective burden being placed on their customers.

(3) Waste is an additional concern. Pet food isn't exactly a low-environmental-impact good, and there's a lot of product that ends up having to be thrown out.

**A couple objections I can hear you cooking up:**

""Ok, so why don't you just go to the store yourself instead of having it shipped?""— Chewy, for one, doesn't have any retail locations. Petsmart and Petco often have lower prices on their websites, which they *will* price match in their stores, but they usually also have additional discounts or offer cash back through Rakuten that can make it much cheaper to purchase items online. There's no option to pick up items in store if the store doesn't already have that item currently in stock. I usually save a lot of money having food shipped to me, even if I'd rather go to the store myself. Further, there are customers that aren't close to any retail locations whose only option is to have the items shipped.

""The problem is with the shipper, not the retailer!""— That is in part true. Especially if the shipper is FedEx. I'm not just arbitrarily picking on FedEx; in my anecdotal experience, at least 50% of the packages I have delivered to me by FedEx (pet food or otherwise) arrive *significantly* damaged (boxes smashed, crushed, partially open, etc.). So part of the problem is with how the shipping companies handle the items in their care. But the thing is, these pet retailers *know* that this is a problem. It then becomes their responsibility to either (a) package their items better to prevent damage, or (b) use a different shipping company that can actually deliver packages without destroying them. They're failing at this responsibility.

**So, what's my point here?** 

My point is that is a big, very real problem that these companies shouldn't just keep getting away with. (As a side note, how do they even afford to keep doing this? Are enough people just not seeking refunds/replacements?) If they can't ship these cans safely, they shouldn't ship them. They should stop incentivizing online vs. in-store purchases, and they should figure out packaging adequately designed to ship them safely.

I don't know how to solve the problem, and beyond writing this too-long post, I personally don't have the energy or resources to do it. Is there some governmental body that consumers can report to? Is there a journalist somewhere that could investigate the scope of the issue? Is this grounds for a class-action lawsuit? I genuinely don't know.",post,4,0.84,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1h99rfh/the_pervasive_problem_of_dented_pet_food/,Chewy

**SOLSTICE MAGNOLIA (OIL)**

*(Lemon-Magnolia ice cream, sugar cone, Hawaiian sandalwood, honeysuckle, thumbprint cookies with quince jam, unsweetened iced black tea)*

smells like feet. i am not putting this on my skin. i’m not doing it i’m not brave enough to do this. WHAT is up with ss’ citrus notes? i don’t understand what’s going on here, it just smells like molded citrus fruits? i’m just, so discombobulated right now, i have never had such a terrible hit rate with a house before. like, i KNOW that i’m very very picky with what i consider great and i rarely FS but man! this is terrible! i have so many alkemia samples i’d like to destash simply because i find them meh, but at least i keep coming back for more. but this? god, i’m sorry but i’m highly considering tossing it just to get it out of my house.

***0/5***

**SPIRIT TREE (OIL)**

*(Gardenia, Vanilla, Jasmine, Sandalwood, Soft Woods blend, Orange Blossom, Magnolia)*

sandalwood and you guessed it, feet. again. i swear, ss’ magnolia and sandalwood scents just turn into the grossest thing ever. i’m so sorry, i don’t want to be mean when reviewing but my goodness, i can’t ever see myself wear this or even try to destash it to someone else. i smell literally NOTHING else in the bottle except for sandalwood and molded citruses, and maybe magnolia. i can’t, i can’t do it, i’m not strong enough to try it on my skin.

***0/5***

**ORIENT ROSE (OIL)**

*(Rose Absolutes, Rose Ottos, Rose de Mai, Rose Attar, Tea Rose Accord, Vanilla Musk, White Musk, Ambergris (vegan), Amber, Indian Vetiver)*

literally made me say “what the fuck” out loud when opening the vial. this thing is FOUL. smells like if you took the same rose in fantome’s finist but it’s like, rotten. and left out to rot for about a month, there’s something that’s desiccated in here and frankly i’m too afraid to smell it again. 

***0/5***

**MANOR (OIL)**

(*Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood)*

well, i mean, it’s not bad in the bottle. and that’s nice, compared to the previous ss fragrances i’ve tried, but to me it just smells sort of like, stale sandalwood and a hint of oud? i’m actually willing to try this one on my skin. has poor projection, and i can’t really smell it when putting my nose right up to it. i don’t get the hype for this at all. it just smells like i rubbed some sandalwood onto my skin. i don’t get any vanilla at all. but all things considered, i’m glad it didn’t go complete funk on my skin.

***2/5***

**ESTATE VANILLA (EDP)**

*(Raw Vanilla Pods, Vanilla Infused Sugar, Cream & Vanilla Extract.)*

yeah that’s vanilla alright. before it sort of smelled like tootsie rolls but that’s faded, i don’t know there’s just nothing that really knocks my socks off with this one. i don’t really understand the hype around it. also the projection isn’t great, i know that edps are usually supposed to have better projection than oils but this is not impressing me at all.

***2/5***

**BLACKBURN FARMSTEAD (OIL)**

*(Blackberry Jam, Boysenberry Preserves, Vanilla Bean, Creamy Vanilla and a touch of Vanilla Musk)*

smells exactly like biting into a blackberry gummy, like it’s chewy? i feel like i’m eating this for some reason, maybe because it is SO strong in the bottle. this stuff is intense just in the vial. loses a lot of projection when it comes into contact with my skin. i mean, for what it’s advertised as it’s a, dare i say, pleasant blackberry scent but it’s pretty linear. there’s no vanilla in here that i can smell.

***3/5***

**BLACKBURN'S PARLOR (OIL)**

*(Vanilla Waffle Bowl, Vanilla & Chocolate Ice Creams, Banana, Caramel, Whipped Cream)*

surprisingly accurate cavendish banana and chocolate! and just the faintest hint of whipped cream in the background. however there’s also this very, i guess artificial quality to it that makes me feel like i shouldn’t be smelling this, like it hurts to smell a little. i think the banana is doing that to be honest. has better projection that the other ss’ smells i’ve been brave enough to put to skin but that isn’t saying much. there’s another fruit that comes out to play when i put it to skin, but i can’t really name it? turns from actual cavendish banana into ugh, it’s just on the tip of my tongue. but it delves from banana into more juicy fruit territory. just the faintest whisper of chocolate, and no waffle cone to be seen.

***2.5/5***

**POSTPRANDIAL (OIL)**

*(Vanilla, Irish Cream, Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon, Pipe Tobacco)*

like prying off the lid of a bottle of bourbon and huffing it. nearly pure alcohol in the bottle, it’s like sniffing rubbing alcohol. it’s enough to make nearly anyone recoil a bit. bitter, with the same sort of vanilla veneer present in estate vanilla. this is what drinking vanilla extract would be like in scent form. on skin it dissolves to a sort of root beer smell? but with actual beer in it. yeah, root beer, heavy emphasis on the beer and a sad bowl of melted vanilla ice cream. also has absolutely terrible projection on me, i can barely smell it with my nose damn near pressed right against it.

***1/5***

**MIDNIGHT EYE (OIL)**

*(Dark Coffee, Cigar Leaf, Cacao, Carob, Tonka, Labdanum, Aged Patchouli, Fossilized Amber, Cigar Ash, Oud)*

like a cigar and oud had a baby. and don’t get me wrong i like oud, very much more than i do sandalwood actually but this is a lot. heavy, oppressive and frankly not suitable for daily wear in my opinion. another ss perfume where i feel like i’m doing damage to my olfactory and nervous system by smelling it. clings to the back of my nose like it lives there. if you like singeing your nose hairs for some reason then this is your best bet. yeah, all other notes are crushed mercilessly under the heel of oud and cigars.

***0/5***

**SNOWMINT MALLOW (OIL)**

*(Peppermint, Vanilla Cake, Sugar Cookies, Flaked Coconut & Marshmallow Crème)*

oh this is quite nice actually, very mint heavy in the bottle but there’s nice sweetness to it. it actually feels cool to my nose when i smell it. smells like thin mint girl scout cookies, (i have native’s shampoo in the same smell but this is better.) yes, this is how i smell like after a shower lol, because i use native’s thin mint shampoo and their coconut macaroon conditioner. it’s not bad, but i already smell like this most of the time. projection on skin isn’t that great. the peppermint mellows out a lot on the skin and the cooling mentholated feeling dissipates, more vanilla forward now that the mint takes a back seat. it’s nice, but it’s not wow-worthy to me. actually, the mint takes more of an irish goodbye, and it’s only been, about 45 seconds since i put it on my skin?

***2.5/5***

**SUGARVALE (OIL)**

*(Candied Pecans, Butterscotch, Buttered Rum, Brown Sugar, Maple Syrup, Hot Pralines & Milk Chocolate Cocoa.)*

immediately it’s butterscotch and buttered rum heavy in the bottle, very butter heavy which i’m not a huge fan of. there’s also a sort of nuttiness to it which i believe comes from the pecans and the pralines? it’s like snacking on candied nuts and sipping on a butterscotch buttered rum cocktail between bites. the maple doesn’t stand out a lot to me, and the milk chocolate isn’t present either. it’s mainly nutty and buttery in the vial. stays mostly the same on skin as well, and maybe there’s just a whisper of maple there as well. it’s alright, but it’s not something i see myself wearing.

***2.3/5***

**ROSE MALLOW CREAM (OIL)**

*(Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk)*

no. same dusty desiccated rose in orient rose, there is nothing sweet or nice or mallow-y about this one. i don’t know how this one turned out so different from the listed notes but it’s uh, it’s not good. like marshmallows if you took everything out of them and only left the gelatin, and like, a dusty rose coughed on it.

***0/5***

**NIGHTGOWN (OIL)**

*(Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers.)*

it’s nothing that really blows me out of the water. creamy sort of white flower smell, i think it’s mainly the tiare? white chocolate is non existent, it’s not an offensive scent by any means but i think that it works against it in this case. doesn’t wow me. 

smells like fantome's olwyn, but it’s a lot less complex. i think my skin amps creamy white florals too much, and i much prefer jasmine as my white flower.

***2.8/5***

**ESTATE CITRUS (EDP)**

*(Orange, Grapefruit, Orange Blossoms, Sweet Tea with Lemon, Estate Vanilla, Honeysuckle, Saffron, Yakusugi Wood, Amber, Patchouli, Distant Coastal Wind)*

doesn’t smell citrusy at all, there’s nothing in here that screams citrus to me despite this being chock full of orange and grapefruit, i don’t know it just smells like molded oranges. sillage isn’t good either for being an edp.

***1/5***

well, there you have it folks. hopefully my experiences can help someone out in the end, so that it wasn't entirely a bust. it looks like i just have a bone to pick with ss' sandalwood and citruses and florals. sometimes the whole house is a bust, and sometimes it's all great and sometimes it's a mix of both, all apart of the fragrance journey i suppose. (though i do feel a headache brewing after smelling all of these.)

i currently have the niteangel 47 inch vista cage with the 12 inch wheel from them as well. most of the hideouts/chambers are from niteangel, except the two ceramic ones, which are from bucastate. he has around 10 inches of bedding and i recently took out the grapevine branch bc when i had it in the enclosure, he would just walk around it so im trying to search for a new branch he could go on. cork logs aren't easily available in my area, so id have to wait to get it from chewy or petco (assuming i can find things that id need that would meet the $35 minimum for free shipping LOL). the pet stores around my area dont really have the cork logs or anything cork/grapevine branch related, so it's a bit hard for me to just buy them. he also has different sprays but he has no interest in them despite me leaving them around the cage. i have rice, wheat, oat, red sorghum (I dont think im spelling it right), and millets (the smaller ones and the clustered ones). so idk what im missing :c

i have a 4 month old syrian who keeps trying to escape because he found out recently that the lid is the way to get out of the cage, as he has done it once before when he climbed on top of the cactus and climbed to the top of the cage and almost got out. i got there in time luckily to see him doing that and moved the castle to the back of the cage. my question is how to stop him from wanting to escape because he does this every now and then, but this week, he's been doing it a lot more. 

i have lotus pods coming in (for hiding treats/seeds/forage). i also have different treats and chews/forage (flowers/herbs) coming in as well, but not until monday. i want to make sure he's not unhappy, but it just doesn't seem like he is happy because he keeps wanting to escape. he doesn't seem stressed, but i could be misreading the situation, and he may be stressed. i guess my question is, does anyone have any advice on what i can do to provide better enrichment for him. 

note: he does have playpen time, and he usually doesn't show that he wants to escape, but today is the day he chose he wants to start his plan to escape and climbs everything he sees in sight. i want to make him feel at home bc i got him like 2 weeks ago, but i don't want to rush him into feeling like things are going to be ok when he doesn't feel the way i do. 

any help, big or small changes would help me. ",post,27,0.97,19,https://v.redd.it/5mdk5gwnmjve1,Chewy
160,Chewy,chewy flowers,1hba3kq,N/A,2024-12-10,"Vegan food I had in Osaka - Miyajima - Himeji - Kyoto - Tokyo This sub was super helpful, but threads about vegan food is far and in between and did not cover some of my fav in my trip. So I'll be putting down a list of vegan restaurants (plus super vegan friendly places) I ate at during my trip. 

I found information via Happy Cow, Google map lists (I found multiple, some via this sub), and instagram accounts, and sometimes a google maps search finds the lesser known places. https://isitveganjapan.com/ is useful too. 

The ordering per city reflects how much I liked the place, but city order is my reverse travel order. I put Tokyo first because that's where my top 3 are. I was with family so we ordered different things and share. My preference is to support fully Vegetarian/Vegan places over places that are vegan-friendly, no matter how big their vegan menu is.

Super long post incoming. Keep in mind these are my personal experiences, YMMV, and I have missed many great places.

**Tokyo**

[**Loving Hut Tokyo Nishi-Nippori**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/puoTcc2K287MbRYk8)

* My Number 1 meal(s) in Japan, even though it's a long trek out from the nearest JR/Metro line, only open at some specific times of the week, it's well worth the planning and the trip!
* All the rice sets are GREAT. They were so good the two of us ate in and got 2 sets and went back to the counter and ordered another 2 bento as well.
* Soy and lotus root 'eel' especially had the right amount of Chinese peppercorn on it that adds that extra dimension of flavor. I love it when Chinese peppercorns is there by itself (without super hot chilli).
* Karaage had perfect texture. It is a rather more textured-soy texture which I personally love, but may not be what you expect if you were expecting Izakaya Masaka karaage.
* Hamburger was actually Japanese style? She made it out of some kind of loose soy something, was great, served with some kind of tomato sauce (not ketchup).
* Mapo tofu was surprisingly good and left me wanting more Japanese style mapo tofu.
* In each rice set, there was a great variety of really great side dishes, there was salad, a tiny curry korokke, some pickles (fresh cucumber and sesame daikon, neither is too salty) and a small amount of dessert (coconut cream sweet potatoes in ours). The soup has a good amount of veggies, not mostly liquid like a lot of other miso soups we've had this trip.
* I also ordered the mugwort cake. The sweetness level is very light to highlight the mugwort taste. Make sure you eat in so it's warmed up with fresh tofu cream.
* The sushi needs to be pre-ordered, which is a shame, but turns out I might have loved the hot foods more than the sushi.
* Did I mention it's very reasonably priced for Tokyo? If you order the rice sets togo (same amount of food as dine in minus soup), the prices becomes outright amazing.
* Cash only. Maybe IC card accepted but I didn't ask for that.
* Check their Instagram account for opening state and events etc.
* **Recommend:** Everything, but ""Eel"" and Mapo tofu in particular.

**T's Tantan Ramen**

* Not putting a google maps link for this one since it has so many branches including the airports! But that's for a VERY good reason, their ramen is simply AMAZING! My Number 2 in Japan, almost tied for Number 1.
* Golden Sesame TanTan is the promoted ramen that's plastered all over the place for a good reason. It really is GREAT. I accidentally ordered Konjac noodles instead of large portion noodles, but it fits amazingly well in this ramen broth.
* The autumn seasonal soy sauce(?) ramen was also amazing. In this bowl I managed to order the large portion of wheat noodles I initially wanted, and it's like DOUBLE the amount of noodles haha, we ended up scooping the extra noodles into the Sesame tantan broth and it's also great.
* Their wheat noodle is what I envisioned good Japanese ramen to be. Maybe it's not handmade (they are a chain after all) but it really hits my spot.
* Both broths are very drinkable.
* Did I mention their prices are amazing too?
* Their cup ramen is my top cup noodle now! Comes with veggies that somehow become super fresh after rehydration. Had them hot on Zipair. If your Zipair flight offers them, go for it! It costed us 500 yen per cup which was fine with us since they bring it to you with hot water already in it. But you should also buy some from convenience stores if you see any! (They cost more from the restaurant for some reason)
* **Recommend:** Golden Sesame Tantan, konjac noodle (at least once), cup ramen (from supermarket or conbini).

[**VEGAN GYOZA YU**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fgtnVgEgTyQSjz4R8)

* A bit of a walk from JR/metro stations, but also worth it. My Number 3 favorite in Japan
* They serve one thing only and does it VERY WELL. Multi-colored, super instagrammable dumplings, hand made from filling to wrapper.
* The wrapper is LEGIT. Hand made, fresh, no fillers or preservatives. I know because I make my own dumpling wrappers from scratch too.
* Each colored dumpling has its own flavor, we only ordered steamed, since we both wanted steamed more than pan-fried, and gyoza isn't really sharable.
* The best one is Shiitake. They gave each set 2 of Shiitake because one of their flavors (some kind of fresh pickled cabbage?) was seasonal only... But at least there was 2 of the best flavor!
* Each gyoza has a rather different flavor, all of them good, some of them GREAT.
* The reason this place is only number 3 in my books is because some flavors are a tad salty, had to drink a lot of water. I mentioned this to the server (who spoke English) but she said that some people still wanted soy sauce with their dumplings...???
* As a side note, I consider dumplings that requires soy sauce/some kind of salty sauce WEAK since that means their fillings does not have enough flavor. Not a problem in this gyoza place!
* **Recommend:** They only have 1 set meal, I love the steamed version, can't say anything about pan-fried but it looks good without being too oily.

[KOMEDA is □ Higashi Ginza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DF9pB8arVcPtoPoT6)

* One of Japan's favorite chain kissaten but the only vegan branch in the entire nation (for now, hopefully)
* Open super early for breakfast, has a good value breakfast deal. But it's only good if you like fluffy puffy Japanese bread.
* I liked their sandwiches a lot more! Great variety too.
* A non-vegan Japanese friend ordered a burger (they have burgers but with Japanese style sauces), and said it tasted so good he won't have guessed it's vegan!
* We should have eaten here a lot more often...
* **Recommend:** Sandwiches! And maybe burger.

[hal okada vegan patisserie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHXFyXadzcigudvs5)

* Not near any sightseeing spots I wanted to go to, but I've also been following their instagram for ages so I just had to go.
* Fresh, packed super well, survived me careless carrying it around through shopping and trains. I got a cheesecake that was gone far too fast for my own good.
* **Recommend:** Yes. (whatever they have on day of your visit)

[Injoy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1MwXWkrfEgURzqv26)

* Taiwanese vegan place really near Asakusa metro. But food isn't exactly Taiwanese.
* Lunch sets gets bundled with expensive Taiwan herbal tea that tastes strongly of ginseng. I'm not a fan. Don't know about dinner time.
* Best item is bibimbap surprisingly, the stone pot is actually hot so you get crispy rice at the bottom. Full of tasty veggies.
* **Recommend:** Bibimbap! Dandan noodle is fine too, but I'd recommend T's for that.

[Hatoya’s Vegan Fruit Sandwiches](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HGdL5JXxfKvHQ97K9)

* Conveniently located near Sensoji, but inconveniently only open at 11am which is when all the crowd is there too.
* It's exactly what it looks like, soy cream filled sandwiches with fruits in them.
* I got a strawberry one. The hidden ""corner"" of the triangle shaped sandwich bread, did, in fact, contain more whole strawberry. Tasty.
* Soy cream tastes very fresh. But in the end, it tastes like exactly what is said on the tin, white Japanese bread, fruit, sweet cream. Not something I actively crave or dream about.
* There are 2 vegan fruit sandwich places in Tokyo, but I chose to have it here since it's near Sensoji. (The other one is fruit and season, that place seems to have more fruit variety but is higher priced and needs a drink order if you want to dine-in.)
* **Recommend:** I think it's seasonal fruits, but strawberry should always be on the options (probably using frozen fruit).

[SUNDAY VEGAN](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9fPjrShLZMvsbhbE6)

* The reason to walk between Ghibli museum and Kichijoji Station.
* They only have sweet donuts and maybe tea/coffee, but one of the best sweet donut I've ever had. (and I've had them aplenty all across California)
* Got the staff recommended soy cream filled donut and chocolate erm, square shaped donut? Don't remember the name. But both are light and fluffy to perfection
* JUST the right level of sweetness.
* **Recommend:** Soy cream filled donut, but best ask the friendly shop staff who speaks basic English.

[AIN SOPH. Soar IKEBUKURO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q4cD5LdeaVfgXqfZ7)

* I avoided Ain Sophs around Tokyo/Kyoto since the menu looks pretty Western without the localization changes in sauces like Komeda Is \_ but they are in good locations.
* Took a brief snack here between shopping, so only got a small salad and single side of soy cutlet.
* The one meal item I wanted to try from them (mushroom hayashi rice) was OOS that day...
* Soy cutlet tastes fine, has with a crispy batter coat. White sauce significantly better than black.
* Small salad comes with good dressing and a few small bits of avocado. Surprisingly tasty.
* Don't miss their dessert menu! I did :(
* **Recommend:** Salad. Seriously. I'd have also ordered the Creme Brulee too but forgot about the dessert menu.

Tea shop inside Teamlab Borderless

* Everything is vegan but a bit overpriced, but you are paying for experience of having flowers in your tea and a flowering tree grow out of your icecream bowl.
* **Recommend:** Rice milk tea + ice cream.

[8balish](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Tpj6X2rvuVJCREqY8)

* Conveniently right across teamlabs Borderless, decent vegan food.
* Menu looks a lot like what I'd find in the US instead of in Japan.
* The bagel with cream cheese was chewy and tough. Don't bother.
* The assorted tapas vegetables of the day with rice was decent.
* **Recommend:** Tapas set of the day, dessert.

Honorable mention:  [Tofu maker in Asakusa 栃木家商店](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h51CU1QdJSSuR1ZE9)

* Makes and sell fresh tofu products, we found them by accident by smelling the scent of freshly made tofu when walking a side street.
* Not everything is vegetarian, shop staff understands vegetarian but not much English, so knowing basic Japanese vocab about vegan food / Google translate helps.
* Sells a soy sauce +wasabi + chopsticks set for 50yen so you can eat the fresh soy products you just purchased.
* Their star product Asakusa Yuba is almost like drinking soy milk, I still like regular yuba more, but worth a try.
* The fried tofu patty-like thing turned out rather bland by itself, and with soy sauce it's still mediocre.
* **Recommend:** Abura-age (fried tofu sheet, lasts long without fridge). Yuba (only if you can eat it in a couple of hours, goes bad FAST).

[Izakaya Masaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n46fBjNNvBsmNKnv7)

* The Shibuya mall it's in has a great Nintendo, Capcom, and other game/animanga stores on its top floor.
* The only time we had to wait for seats in Japan. People who arrived 10 minutes after us were refused entry, we got on the waiting list so we were ok.
* When we went in, a lot of items were sold out. No mapo tofu so we made do with karaage, which was was good tasting but not enough crispiness. This is a ""softer"" kind of mock meat, probably mimics chicken better? I've been vegan for too long to be able to tell.
* The crispy fried Maitake mushroom was more crispy but does not come with sauce and the batter tastes unsalted.
* Rice was left in steaming for WAY too long and has became mushy. Worst rice we had in Japan. Still worth it since you need rice for all the salty stuff, get the rice set.
* Gyoza was fine. Did not get burnt. The people next to us was served spring rolls that was charred.
* Mizuna salad was too salty+spicy and comes way before the rice, dressing and salt well not mixed well.
* Maybe this is an authentic izakaya experience? But prices aren't low for what you get.
* **Recommend:** Karaage + rice set (maybe mapo tofu is better that's why it sold out). But you aren't missing out if you don't get to enter.

[Taiyaki Hiiragi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B8GWX5uMfVRDY3PE8)

* Vegan taiyaki (red bean filling). No queues.
* Filling is a tad too sweet, the fish shaped shell is crispy but a bit too thin. I preferred the Gozasoro pastries (later in this post).
* Only eat one if you have to have a vegan taiyaki near a metro station. I believe there is one other place with naturally vegan taiyaki called Nezu Taiyaki but that's a bit out of the way of metro, and has queues.

[Komaki Shokudo Kamakura Fushikian](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dHipu5eUFy7qLmqA6)

* Only (?) full vegan place in Akibahara, but you should seriously just take the JR to another station with T's Tantan instead, especially if it's dinner time. Or maybe I was ripped off with tourist menu?
* I was charged 2200 yen for a tiny amount of udon, tiny amount of super tough green veggies, small bits of mushroom that doesn't even add up to a single mushroom, one piece of too-sweet aburaage, and soup that was too salty to drink. There's a tiny amount of rice to supposedly wash down that soup, but it's so tiny. Oh and some very thinly sliced. I'd be ok with it if I was only charged half of this, but 2200 is ridiculous.
* Not recommended, or just don't get their kitsune udon, it's a total ripoff. (EDIT: changed wording of this section to something less strong after reading horror stories from carnivore meals in Japan)

***Places I wanted to go but had to skip because of scheduling/timing etc:***

[Veganic Monkey Magic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kq9TTUfsEiQSPFwf7) (reservation only! but their mostly dinner-only schedule clashed with our trip plans, so we had to pass on this. There's an Airbnb upstairs Oyado Matsumura that I almost booked, but I decided on a proper hotel in the end.)

[Marugoto Vegan Dining Asakusa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g5FTJS5ebv7TubDKA) (was a hard decision between this and Injoy)

[Bon 梵](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s3zf2S2Ky59kyVLF9) (drooled over this on instagram, but looked expensive and I wasn't hyped enough to make the out-of-the-way trip, and I was disillusioned with ""fine-dining"" from the Shigetsu experience, more on that in Kyoto section.)

[the vegan marshmallooow ザ ヴィーガン マシュマロ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JiGXDVsVN8bGCbCY6) (dessert shop in Ginza)

[2foods](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5EU4YPfTEU4opsaB7) (they seem to be donut+burger focused but also have omurice and some other things)

[Vegan Bistro Jangara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PF27yc21DpKiq7Jx7) (there's nothing I wanted to visit in Harajuku except this place, and I'm not hyped enough to make this extra stop)

[Guruatsu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zbahqa29EgZse2Ax8) (near Ueno station, I ended up skipping Ueno park+museum because I was tired from Kyoto walking...)

[Sarasya Shinsen Chaen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MPskkSZdQAXNSHaU7) (right in the middle between Mitaka station and Ghibli Museum, but they only JUST re-opened with irregular opening hours and limited stock. I didn't want to go to Ghibli hungry in case they run out of food or something when we reach there.)

**Kyoto**  
Interestingly, I did not love the food in Kyoto as much I expected. Maybe because quite a few of the places I wanted to go to were not open that day unannounced (Izakaya nijiya), or reservation recommended (and we were too tired to go and TRY, hindsight we should have tried), or they closed a few months ago... Don't rely on Happy Cow, Google Map search the word ""vegan"" gives more immediate vicinity results.

[Ramen Towzen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PL8insVTnhF7hoef8)

* Hard to get to, the wait for the bus to get there was LONG (bus timetables goes completely out of the window with Kyoto night traffic). Take a taxi. It'll make your meal a lot more enjoyable.
* The ramen itself has alright texture, its alkaline-ness was a bit more noticable than other places. Musashi broth was pretty good, but not as great as I hoped  (maybe I just hyped myself up too much from all the waiting). Still my favorite meal in Kyoto.
* Musashi ramen comes with a tiny piece of yuba on top, it left me wanting the yuba sashimi, but the set comes with potato salad+eggplant sushi+soy pudding dessert and left me really full...
* The highlight was the pressed eggplant sushi! I love my eggplant grilled.
* I like T's in Tokyo better for Dandan noodles.
* **Recommend:** Musashi ramen set (with eggplant sushi and salad). Tried both and this is the better one.

[silver backs cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HX82DLHRkxULM6Rr5)

* The logo looks exactly like the owner!
* Pretty tasty food, but menu had a lot of non-Japanese-ish foods like Pho and nachos? Nope, we were tourist to Kyoto and wanted only Japanese-ish foods! (like, Japanese style curry is ok, but I'm not ordering Thai green curry in Kyoto if I can help it). Nevertheless, it probably is a good thing for Japanese people to eat vegan food from all over the world.
* Ended up with the Japanese lunch set and grilled ""meat"" set.
* **Recommend:** grilled ""meat"" set, the wasabi dressing salad it comes with pairs very well with the mock meat.

[Vegetarian Cafe Ren Horikawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZFEVT9T4sohtfha38)

* A few bus stops north of Nijo castle, but they should have other chains as well. Turns out they speak Chinese better than their English. Taiwanese owner I think?
* Very varied menu, should have ordered more togo in hindsight.
* **Recommend:** Soy milk hotpot set. Comes with gyoza, which tastes like store bought but it's also one of my favorite brand of store bought gyozas.

[TORIBA COFFEE KYOTO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RPuL7hKNaSSViSrR8)

* ""walking"" distance from Meiji Jingu
* Their food items seem to be all vegan but their lattes seem to be milk by default? We aren't coffee people, can't tell how good is the coffee.
* Sandwiches are tasty but portions are rather small.
* On their ""new item"" menu is a ""fish"" sandwich. It's a perfectly fried some kind of patty (with a tiny bit of veggies in it?). I love my crispy edges in fried foods.
* Also advertised an ""egg"" sandwich, staff (owner?) said it's made with pumpkins. I suspected it's the same recipe as the MERCY cafe one (more on that below) and skipped it.
* **Recommend:** ""Fish"" sandwich, ""katsu"" sandwich.

[Tenryuji Temple Shigetsu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R9hrGUeSVLGWt8E87)

* Most expensive, but far from my favorite place in Kyoto. I pre-ordered the Moon meal (6500yen) and it was a LOT of food.
* Fun dining experience, food is interesting but not the most tasty. The dishes are seasonal, so photos you see of that awesome grilled eggplant? Nope, not there if you go in the wrong season.
* The highlight of the meal was the yuba skin which I think comes with every other set too. The suspected Moon set extra dish was some kind of couscous and dango soup dish and the only thing to note is how filling it is.
* Way too much rice cake in our set. Maybe we just went in the wrong time? What's up with all the rice cakes?
* Tofu looking thing is some kind of nut tofu cake (other reviews say it's sesame but I also taste peanuts). Interesting texture, but one experience is enough.
* If you forgot your reservation, there's another Yudofu place nearby that's fully vegetarian! Seizan Sodo.
* **Recommend:** reserve your place ahead of time, but stick to the 3800 yen set.

[MERCY Vegan Factory KYOTO STATION](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kVePjvapXPjGgW877)

* I regretfully had only time to grab some togo items, their menu looks amazing
* Great egg salad sandwich!
* However their crossiants/breads are super gluten-y (maybe their dough overdeveloped on that day?), one of the toughest soft bread I've had. Shame, the flavoring was great.
* **Recommend:** egg salad sandwich (but I should have went back and ordered something as dine in)

[CAFE TEA TERRACE (VEGAN, GLUTEN-FREE, VEGETARIAN)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e81KaG4EPte2jhyv5)

* Ramen soup was good, comes with decent amount of veggies, but noodle itself was millet based and has a pretty rough texture. I guess it's because they needed a gluten free food item? Celiac/gluten allergic people would appreciate this better than we did.
* Egg salad sandwich filling tasted JUST like the one from MERCY, but is in a thick toast pocket instead of fluffy plain bread, and I enjoyed this one more. I encountered the same claim of ""vegan pumpkin based egg salad"" sandwich in Toriba coffee too, so now I'm suspecting they are all from one single supplier (MERCY?).
* Dango set is too expensive for what it is, so they tried to make up for it by putting gold in the sesame sauce... the result is acceptable but not worth it.
* **Recommend:** egg salad sandwich (if you haven't had the one from MERCY or any other places in Kyoto.)

Honorable mention:

[Gyomu Super Sanjo-kawaramachi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ff4AKgXsRxgowiPj8)

* Small supermarket in the middle of one of the busiest areas in Kyoto, but with SUPER CHEAP PRICES. It's where restaurants go and get their supplies.
* Never pay for edamame in a restaurant because you can get them for super cheap in here!
* They have decently priced fresh tofu, veggies, microwave rice, mochi... Enough for a half decent dinner/breakfast if you have access to a microwave.
* Not a lot of vegan instant food selection (didn't check their curry sauce section), so you may need to get some sauce. We opted for rubbing some salt from the pre-salted edamame instead...
* **Highly recommended if you want to save some money**

There was also a small stall selling tofu manju section in the back of Okutan Kiyomizu (which isn't vegan because of dashi, no idea how friendly they actually are). The tofu manju is vegan (the girl took out an ingredients card to check too). But it's skin is really sweet while the filling is a savory and NOT worth it.

***Places I wanted to go but had to skip:***

[Gion Soy Milk Ramen Uno Yokiko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3abhJSLjAFA7oVdQA) I wanted to go, but got tired from walking sooo much that day.

[VEGAN IZAKAYA 虹屋 nijiya VEGAN FARM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6TUrXujZS3cR5gFk7) was closed without notice on the day I was there.

[Seizan Sodo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nbt3eTfngjsvoTBH7) vegetarian Yudofu place really near Arashiyama station, I was recommended this if Shigetsu didn't have open spots for lunch. So don't fret if you forget to do reservations!

[Daitokuji Ikkyu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HKStwDXdteBuYLRq6) right next to Daitoku-ji Temple (Ikkyu temple). I didn't check if it's possible to walk in though... I might have been disappointed without a reservation.

[Vegan Ramen UZU Kyoto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aZPa5fZt4rszgWme7) when I wanted to eat there I realized it's their closed days, which was almost all our days in Kyoto...

[waco crepes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oPsRxXgf3SZ7qo8v9) crepe shop with good vegan options, I could never make it there when they are open, even though our hotel is really near the place.

**Himeji**

Because we rode the Hello Kitty Shinkansen here from Hiroshima which arrives at an odd time, we ended up eating lunch at almost 4pm after we finished exploring Himeji Castle and Koko-en. Koko-en, despite good reviews from this sub, is not worth it if it's not height of whatever season you are there, for us it's momiji season but there was hardly any red.

[il riccio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2UEQ2zDx4SFnFf91A)

* The only vegan place that's in between Himeji Castle and train station, follow Google Maps, past the ramen shop right next to it with big signs advertising their VEGAN NOODLE, ignoring their attempt to scam vegan tourists.
* The actual place is half-shop half restaurant. There was a few rice sets we could order. The lunch set of the day was delicious, as was the mushroom-and-gluten rice set. Some dishes are light on salt/soy sauce but you can also taste the flavor of ingredients.
* **Recommend:** lunch set of the day, cookies/bakery items
* There was a few vegan packet ramen in the shop (owner will very helpfully tell you the TRUE vegan ones without hidden dashi), but they were a hit-and-miss, since they aren't in cups so you need to get a microwave container to cook them as a tourist, and contains no freeze-dry veggies. Just noodle and soup.

**Miyajima**

[Rokaku Tea House (Hexagon Cafe)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RNHjo5MzYYFDzD4a7)

* Right next to the entrance after entering Daishoin temple, look for the cafe sign. Really cute temple!
* I think they always have one rotating food item that's vegan. When we went, it's a very nicely plated curry rice, and there was a vegan soymilk pudding as well!
* Did not taste that much like Japanese curry (it tasted more Indian, but with very little heat) and had nuts in it. Great hot meal in a nice place.

Everything on Miyajima closes around 5pm, and we were tired from walking so did not check if any dinner places have decent vegan options, we just went back to our hotel and ate the brown rice sushi we packed from Osaka. There was a Lawson and Starbucks open, but I didn't go in to check for vegan options.

Hiroshima honorable mention:

[Gozasoro 御座候](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ev1CBAhzKoSATNQv7) (chain bakery of one single kind of Japanese sweet)

* Apparently it's a chain! just google map search this name and see if you have a store near your travel destinations. Or traverse their official shop listing website in Japanese. I've seen locations in train stations aplenty in Kansai, apparently it's in Tokyo as well!
* The basic sweet itself is really cheap and naturally vegan, but this location in particular turns out to also sells pork meat buns as a side hustle. But that's in the steamer and the sweets are from the moulded pans. This just happen to be the location I visited, but because of the pork bun thing I'd probably visit another of their chain locations.
* The sweet itself is pretty good! They'll box it up really nicely for you so it remains warm after a few hours, not overly sweet and we could have it without tea. Both kinds of bean pastes tastes pretty freshly made, not packaged.
* **Recommend:** Get both flavors! They are real cheap.

**Osaka**

[Brown Rice Sushi TEC 玄米のおすしテック ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VqL5CJLdSC2szSb36)

* Opens really early (7:30am). They have a great breakfast deal (before 8am)
* Walking distance from Shin Osaka station
* Only a small table for eating in, pack a lot of things if you the daytrip location you are visiting is inconvenient for vegan food. (for us, it's Miyajima at dinnertime)
* Fresh ingredients, especially the salad leaves they use, and somehow they stay fresh.
* **Recommend:** Chirashi sushi, and anything with their Koji Tofu and Tempeh.

[OKO Takoyaki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MRPS36j2RfMHkyBY6)

* I've seen people confuse this place and their OKO Okonomiyaki location. The Okonomiyaki location is not fully vegan, just vegan friendly. This place is fully vegan.
* That said, I found the takoyaki a bit too soft and starchy. Probably because it's gluten free, so they had to use just starch/starchy vegetable to bind the okara. And it's rather oily.
* Veggies on kushikatsu are tiny. Is it supposed to be tiny?
* Cost wise, extremely good deal since it comes as a set with salad and soup, I liked the salad and kushikatsu better than the takoyaki.
* Given the choice to choose again, I might have gone to Pivot cafe which has takoyaki and other menu items too, or Shinsekai Paprika Shokudo but they are closed on the day we were in Osaka.

***Places I wanted to go but had to skip:***

[Shinsekai Paprika Shokudo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aj1wdcVg37Dgxhiu9) and [Paprika Shokudo Vegan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/m1VuvZDKCQ888W6x5) each place has different menu, Shinsekai branch interested me more but they were closed on the one night I was in Osaka.

[Shojin Sushi Minamo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y49SCQNL2ZM7iZoy8)  new vegan sushi place! but also closed on the days I was in Osaka.

[Aju](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8WkcYa6bdLnjw6L2A) I read this place has only 4 seats... wasn't feeling adventurous to go somewhere that needed a plan B on my first jetlagged night in Japan

[Pivot BASE Cafe & Bar ＠Dotonbori](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nSgZzYU1NCPV3wG9A) their instagram account looks very tourist-targeted which may not be a bad thing, but I chose to try OKO instead since they are more ""famous"".

[MERCY Vegan Factory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CkjL4ykSbuG6F2o56) main branch of the branch in Kyoto.

But at first, I was very confused. I didn’t know who or why I was getting flowers. I joked that my partner had sent me flowers, knowing that wasn’t the case. We were all confused.

i currently have the niteangel 47 inch vista cage with the 12 inch wheel from them as well. most of the hideouts/chambers are from niteangel, except the two ceramic ones, which are from bucastate. he has around 10 inches of bedding and i recently took out the grapevine branch bc when i had it in the enclosure, he would just walk around it so im trying to search for a new branch he could go on. cork logs aren't easily available in my area, so id have to wait to get it from chewy or petco (assuming i can find things that id need that would meet the $35 minimum for free shipping LOL). the pet stores around my area dont really have the cork logs or anything cork/grapevine branch related, so it's a bit hard for me to just buy them. he also has different sprays but he has no interest in them despite me leaving them around the cage. i have rice, wheat, oat, red sorghum (I dont think im spelling it right), and millets (the smaller ones and the clustered ones). so idk what im missing :c

i have a 4 month old syrian who keeps trying to escape because he found out recently that the lid is the way to get out of the cage, as he has done it once before when he climbed on top of the cactus and climbed to the top of the cage and almost got out. i got there in time luckily to see him doing that and moved the castle to the back of the cage. my question is how to stop him from wanting to escape because he does this every now and then, but this week, he's been doing it a lot more.

i have lotus pods coming in (for hiding treats/seeds/forage). i also have different treats and chews/forage (flowers/herbs) coming in as well, but not until monday. i want to make sure he's not unhappy, but it just doesn't seem like he is happy because he keeps wanting to escape. he doesn't seem stressed, but i could be misreading the situation, and he may be stressed. i guess my question is, does anyone have any advice on what i can do to provide better enrichment for him.

note: he does have playpen time, and he usually doesn't show that he wants to escape, but today is the day he chose he wants to start his plan to escape and climbs everything he sees in sight. i want to make him feel at home bc i got him like 2 weeks ago, but i don't want to rush him into feeling like things are going to be ok when he doesn't feel the way i do.

any help, big or small changes would help me.",post,10,0.92,6,https://v.redd.it/vz93q7yqojve1,Chewy

I decided to do some math to see if the price difference between the smallest and largest doses actually makes sense—and what I found is pretty messed up. My boy is 135lbs and my vet insists he also gets the additional small pill since he's over the limit. 

Here’s the Breakdown Based on Total Milligrams per Chew (prices from Chewy WITH discount:

1. Smallest Dose (2.8–5.5 lbs):

Total mg per chew: 2.572 mg

Price per year (12 doses, autoship): $330.87

Cost per mg: $10.73 per mg


2. Largest Dose (88.1–132 lbs):

Total mg per chew: 373.44 mg

Price per year (12 doses, autoship): $384.22

Cost per mg: $0.086 per mg

........

Key Finding: WTF?!

The smallest dose is over 120 times more expensive per mg than the largest dose.

Even though the largest dose has 145 times more active ingredients, it only costs $53.35 more per year than the smallest dose.

This feels like a blatant rip-off for giant breed owners like me who are stuck paying way more for essentially the same meds.

Has Anyone Else Noticed This?

Is there any justification for this kind of price disparity, or are we just getting screwed by Zoetis?

Warning: Simparica is not the same.  

Almost every US pharmacy, petmed online, chewy, petco etc. charged $188.  There were some discounts on first orders or autoship.  I was looking for ongoing price, so discounts on the first order weren't of interest.

  
Costco had it for about $120/150 depending if you were a member.

PetVnm offered it for $153.

I did not check on shipping, sales tax, or if you needed a script.  In WA state, shipping/tax could add another $26 to the order.

I then went to Canadian pet med places.  Most prices were under $100.

  
I ended up buying it from Canadapetcare.com.  It was 97.53.  I found a coupon online for 20% off the order.  They automatically select $6.95 for tracked shipping, but I chose free.  No script required.  I paid $78 instead of $200.

Probiotics are not helping and that seems to be all that vets have to offer me since this isn’t from a bacterial infection that can just be fixed by antibiotics.

220,Chewy,chewy autoship,1jz4rf2,N/A,2025-04-14,"FIXED! [hopefully] LR4 Stopping Every Cycle We have two LR4s.  One is two years old.  One is two months old.  Having 3 cats, one wasn't quite enough.  We added the litter hopper to the older one about a month or so before we bought the new one (which also has the hopper).

Shortly after adding the hopper, the older LR4 would stop every cycle.  Every. Single. Cycle.  I would get the notification in the app that the scale had been active for 30+ minutes.  Then I'd reset it from the app and it would resume the cycle.

I tried every troubleshooting tip I could find on the website, on reddit, on YouTube, you name it.  Nothing worked.  Then, one day it started working again out of the blue.  I noticed that the litter was way low, about an inch and a half below the ""optimal"" line.  I wasn't paying attention and let the hopper empty completely, so every time it cycled the level was getting lower.

When I filled the hopper and added litter to the globe, it paused again its first cycle.  This led me to believe that it was a weight sensor issue.  When it was lighter ie less litter, it ran fine, but when it was full it would cause a fault.  While I was talking to support, she asked me what litter I was using, and when I told her Dr. Elsey's Ultra, she told me that could be the issue as it's heavier and more dense than most litters, so when it's at the optimal line, it weighs a lot more.

I swapped it to a different litter and it's working fine, while it's full.  Problem solved.  Here's what surprised me: the new LR4 uses the same litter and hasn't had an issue at all.  I think the newer ones are better equipped to differentiate litter types and make the adjustments.  I have the app updated to show Dr. Elsey's, but the old one still had issues while the new one worked fine.  I'm going to monitor everything for the rest of the day, and if I don't have anymore issues, I'm going to switch our litter autoship at Chewy's.

I hope this helps.  I was pulling my hair out wondering why it wasn't working.  I thought it was because I added the hopper, but I realize that was just coincidentally when I switched the litter.  I was looking for a lower dust litter as the old one was causing one of our cats to sneeze a LOT.",post,2,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/litterrobot/comments/1jz4rf2/fixed_hopefully_lr4_stopping_every_cycle/,Chewy

223,Chewy,chewy autoship,1hz4bow,N/A,2025-01-11,"Am I wrong? AITAH? I don’t need medical advice, but I have been becoming increasingly frustrated with my vets office/staff and I want to know if I’m crazy for being upset. 

For context, I have been seeing my current vet for 4 years and I have 2 dogs and 2 cats. Both of my dogs are on daily, lifelong medications and one of them is also on prescription diet. Point being, I am well aware that regular check ups are necessary to keep up prescriptions. In my 4 years as a client with 4 animals, none of them have ever been behind on they’re regular exams with then only exception being I pushed my young, healthy cats annual back a couple months at one point to make the vet schedule financially more tolerable for myself. I also work as a dog groomer so I know how nasty pet parents can be. I can truly only imagine how nasty people are to vet staff and I always make a point to just be an easy client. 

One of my dogs, Chewy takes thyro tabs and I’ve had them on autoship for almost two years at this point I get 120 tabs for just under 10$ plus 6$ shipping delivered every 8 weeks. On 12/3 my vets office called asking that I schedule Chewys annual so they can fill the script. I was busy at work so I couldn’t do it on the phone at that exact moment, but I did schedule online within a couple of hours and sent a message. The person on the phone was incredibly rude, wouldn’t give me a date of when he needed to be seen and just kept saying it’s been “almost a year” and they wouldn’t fill the script until I had an appointment on the books. When I asked for his exam due date and she couldn’t provide me one she said “it’s not my fault we changed systems”- this becomes important.

I did what was asked and scheduled a morning appointment for 1/6. Rather than send the script through as promised, they canceled it. I had extra pills to last until the appointment though so I never made a fuss. I live 25 minutes away and they called me 15 minutes before my appointment to cancel because the doctor was out sick. I never complained about the doctor being out, as inconvenient as it was for me I recognize that he’s human and life happens. I did complain though because at that point I was really low on meds and needed more and the script had been canceled rather than filled. While there I find out Chewy was due to be seen by 1/29/25 so almost an entire 2 months after they were refusing to fill his meds. I expressed frustration at the script being canceled and I’m told “it’s not my fault the doctor is sick” and “we can’t fill that, it’s not my fault you were given false information”. I mention only having ABOUT a weeks worth of meds left and they take his blood work and say after they get the results they will give me enough to get by until his new appointment on the 28th.

On 1/8 they call me and say they’re going to fill the script. I tell them I will come in the next day or two. At this point I have 2 days of pills left for him and I show up on 1/9. I make yet another trip there to pick up the meds and pay 20$ for 30 tablets. I get to my car only to realize that’s not even enough to get by until the 28th so I got back in. Now, I’m running out of patience. They explain that I said I had about a week left so they intended to give me exactly enough until the 28th but because I didn’t actually have a weeks worth of pills left when I made that estimate, it was short. I’m told “it’s not my fault you said you had a weeks worth of pills”. 

They sell me another 15 pills and charge me 17$! I NEVER complain about prices because I know how annoying and pointless it is, but I do have 4 animals and need to mindful of expenses so needlessly paying 4x the price for less than half the amount is infuriating at this point because I also know now that I will be forced to fill his next script there on the 28th because I won’t have enough at home to wait for it to come through the mail. They tell me there’s a “filling fee” which is why it’s costing me almost the same amount for 14 pills as I just paid for 30 pills. I ask for the fee to be waived, and I’m told “no. It’s not my fault, I don’t make the prices”. I ask for a manager and I’m also told no. I pay the additional 17$ because I literally don’t have a choice at this point. Keep in mind as of this time, my dog is still not over due for an exam!

I have dealt with almost half a dozen different people at this point and every single one of them of them throws their hands up and is so quick to say “it’s not my fault” and time I express any amount of frustration. I feel I’m justified in being frustrated. I’m a patient person and I am kind but I’m truly struggling with this because none of this is my fault either and despite doing what they’ve asked of me at every step along the way and dealing with every single inconvenience I’ve been treated like I’m an asshole for being frustrated. I feel ripped off and betrayed. I’ve never missed an appointment or canceled and again, none of my animals have ever fallen behind on regular checkups. I have a history here and nothing about my pets record would suggest that I won’t show up for this appointment. 

Am I in the wrong here? Am I wrong for being frustrated? Have there been a change to laws that explain why I’ve never had this issue before or better yet, why my other dogs scripts continued get filled with no issues despite him also being due for an annual by 1/29? It’s as if somebody made a mistake somewhere and despite righting it decided to die on the hill and make me pay for it. I wouldn’t be nearly as frustrated if one person would just genuinely apologize and maybe own it but instead all I get is “it’s not my fault” from every single person I’ve interacted with. 

Edit to update: the practice manager called me today (1/13) and it was blatantly obvious where the poor attitudes are coming from. She was very rudely interrupting me and I shut it down because I am now beyond fed up. When I finished she snapped back with “am I allowed to speak now?” and I admittedly finally lost my cool. I called her out on how rude and uncalled for that response was and told her that I can see where everyone’s attitude problem is stemming from. In the end absolutely nothing was resolved. Party because I lost my cool and partly because she seemed to clearly have no interest in taking any responsibility or apologizing regardless. After circular arguments where she refused to acknowledge the fact that as of this moment Chewy is STILL not overdue for an exam. At one point she even started arguing that my other dogs medication was last filled in March 2024 and that is absolutely not true, his medication was actually last filled in December right around when Chewys medication was supposed to be filled (also a 60 day supply). I wish so badly that I would be able to cancel my appointment for both dogs on 1/28 but I know I won’t be able to get them seen elsewhere in time to maintain their prescriptions. 

I appreciate the reassurance I got here because I was feeling so emotional about the situation and with so many people treating me so poorly I was truly wondering if maybe I did do something wrong.",post,5,0.86,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hz4bow/am_i_wrong_aitah/,Chewy

227,Chewy,chewy autoship,1jf57ck,N/A,2025-03-19,"Chronic diarrhea + food trials in my senior pup Hi there, the shorter version is how does one afford Hill's canine Rx diet w/d multi benefit (wet food) for a 60lb dog? I'm not asking for autoship discounts or CareCredit, I'm just genuinely lost on what the next step will be for my dog. 

Longer version: 

My rescue pit mix is 14 and recently stopped eating her last OTC kibble (American Journey). She's also had diarrhea on and off since November. In addition, she has a history of skin cancer, skin allergies, and anal gland issues. I had her left anal gland removed last year and last night she just had her fourth anal gland abscess. Multiple rounds of antibiotics work for the gland but do not resolve the food issue. 

The vet suspected the diarrhea and lack of eating (but not lack of appetite) was a food allergy, likely with the protein (salmon). She then prescribed Royal Canin HP dry food about a month ago. I was worried about the cost ($135ish for the big 25ish lb bag) but went ahead because she needed it. Apple ate it for maybe two weeks before stopping again. 

Today I took her in for wound care for the most recent abscess and they prescribed us Hill's Canine W/D wet food which is great but much more costly. She loves it but the case of 12 was $65 and at 60 lbs, that's 4 cans a day. So a 6 week trial at ~$22 a day is $924. I can't afford that. Even with a slightly cheaper price at Chewy and with autoship. Do people dogs on this long term or could I (after consulting with my vet) switch her to the more affordable dry version and just add warm water to make it more appealing? I only got the prescription for case and got it directly from the vet, so is this a situation where if it works, they'll automatically switch me to the dry? Will I have an option? 

Thanks! Signed, my anxiety and wallet. ",post,1,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1jf57ck/chronic_diarrhea_food_trials_in_my_senior_pup/,Chewy

To make a very long story short, we went from our 12 year old cat being diagnosed with end-stage renal failure and scheduling to put her down to her making a miraculous turn around after 36 hours with the kidney care patè cans and several low protein/low sodium broth. I was so relieved. Even the vet clinic was shocked. 

Since then she’s been reclassified as Stage 3 and we have some hope. That also means more  treatment options. She ended up hating the canned kidney care food, so we switched to dry food. Unfortunately this also means fewer fluids, which is why we’ve begun sub-Q fluids. 

The problem is they’re charging $55 for just 10 days of saline (100mL/day). We can get it about cheaper online, but when I asked if they can approve a prescription for Chewy they said they couldn’t because online vet suppliers aren’t held to the same safety standards.

235,Chewy,chewy vet,1ev2zvo,N/A,2024-08-18,"Chewy online vet chat and cat poison control experience- VERY POSITIVE (TLDR at bottom) Hi everyone, 

I just wanted to bring attention to the experience I had tonight with the cat poison control line and Chewy vet chat. 

This evening, I had left a quarter of my Five Guys burger on my kitchen counter and me and my boyfriend’s cats got to it. Thinking nothing of it, we threw out the remnants and continued with our night. 

After a Google search, my boyfriend had said that onions were toxic to cats and lo and behold, there were diced onions on my burger. 

I saw a comment from someone on this thread that Chewy had a vet chat service available to anyone that has ordered something on there before (NO SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED- I don’t have a subscription). I typed in my login info to Chewy, got on the vet chat (available 6AM to 12AM eastern standard time).

I filled in my cats information and was connected to a vet tech right away. The vet tech offered to connect me with cat poison control and said that, usually, a consultation with them would cost $80 but if I was connected through the Chewy vet, it would cost $59. I was skeptical, so I called the cat poison control myself and they said yes, it would be $80 for a consultation. 

I then went back to the Chewy vet chat and asked them to connect me with poison control. To my surprise, the vet I was speaking with called me directly and put me through to cat poison control. 

When talking to poison control, the woman was very thorough with me and walked me through what I should do (monitor my cats for the next 24 hours). I gave her my card information up front and was charged $59 instead of the $80. 

I can’t tell you how thorough, thoughtful, and kind these people were when I was talking to them. The woman from poison control even pulled up the ingredients of Five Guys and stated that nothing else my cats ingested were poisonous (bun, pickle, cheese, burger- they’re not made with garlic powder either). She also gave me an idea of how much onion my cats had to eat in order for it to be considered toxic (basically 2 1 1/2-2 inch diameter onion rings- way less than what was on the rest of my burger). 

My boyfriend and I are absolutely still going to monitor our cats (I’ll be pulling an all-nighter out of guilt and anxiety) but I had to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with both Chewy and poison control. 

I understand that $59 is still steep, but it’s a bit better than $80. I’d certainly pay $8,000,000 for our little babies to make sure they’re safe and healthy. I’ve absolutely learned my lesson.

TLDR- I have an overwhelmingly positive experience with the Chewy online vet chat and cat poison control when I discovered my two cats ate the last quarter of my Five Guys burger with onions on it.",post,3,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1ev2zvo/chewy_online_vet_chat_and_cat_poison_control/,Chewy

I’m terrified that I’ve severely damaged her kidneys and I feel horrible.  I have a 14 year old cockapoo that I’ve had since she was 8 weeks old. She’s my entire world. We found out this year she has an autoimmune dermatitis condition after we were unable to cure a horrible ear infection with antibiotics - she still has the infection and this series of vet visits started in March. That has me feeling bad enough, I wish she could understand that I’ve spent over a thousand dollars trying to fix this for her and we’re still working on it. 

Anyway, we started a liquid immunosuppressant medication one month ago, and the bottle was supposed to last at least five months. My mother has been administering the meds because it works best with our schedule, and I taught her to give 3mL because that’s what I thought the box said. Today she told me the bottle is almost empty, which shocked me since I paid $250 for a 5 month supply, and that’s when I realized. It says .3, not 3.

Aside from diarrhea in the evening after taking the medicine, which I was told was probably just her adjusting to the meds by my vet, she has been acting 100% like her normal self. But kidney disease doesn’t show symptoms until stage 3, so that doesn’t mean I didn’t ruin her. She already has a vet appointment in a few days. I talked to a Chewy vet tonight and she recommended I call the office tomorrow and see if we can get labs done right away. 

I guess I’m just looking for comfort or something rather than advice since I won’t know anything until we go to the vet. I’m just gutted.

GSDs is a super picky eater. i've seen the advice to take away their food and wait for them to learn that if they're hungry, they'll need to eat what's given to them. however, rosie lost weight from the stress of being in foster care for a few months, and she needs to gain about 10 pounds to be at a healthier weight (my vet's advice). so, i'm not comfortable doing something that could make her _lose_ weight.

(i do have a pumpkin supplement for her to help with this.) i always feed her _after_ we exercise to avoid bloat and ensure she's at least theoretically hungry.

i could write an entire essay on the things i've mixed into her kibble to get her to eat it. the ""acceptable"" ones are cheese and chicken (freeze dried, jerky, home cooked, doesn't matter as long as it's chicken). i have to sit with her the whole time she eats and keep adding more of whatever topping to get her to keep eating. it's a 20 minute battle every meal. and, she never seems to want to go back to a topping we've previously tried. so far it has been various forms of chicken and cheese, some more healthy than others.

i don't mind adding the toppings, but it would be nice if we could find a reliable few to rotate instead of continuously trying something new. i'm going to run out of ""acceptable"" toppings eventually lol. i'm not sure what else to do other than transitioning her kibble. but i'm open to any advice y'all may have! thanks in advance!!!",post,58,0.97,58,https://i.redd.it/t620o3wh91xe1.jpeg,Chewy

**TL/DR version**: >!She lives rent-free by buying into a home with her son’s family in coastal San Diego.!<

My mother is an 84-year-old widow. She gets approximately $1900 a month in SS benefits. She is in moderate health, with arthritis, and heart issues. Her mind is sharp.

She lives a wonderful, full, and comfortable life. She has very little stress. I think she is satisfied with her personal situation. Here is how she did it.

**Her SS History**

At age 60 she semi-retired. She started collecting her SS survivor benefit. She left her full-time, high stress management job. Sold the house. She moved to Arizona and bought a smaller home with a small mortgage. She worked part time at a low stress job at a resort. Between the SS survivor benefit, her part time job, and her lower cost of living, she did fine. She had a yard to grow her garden in and the time to attend to it. She was able to pay off the mortgage by age 70 and buy herself a small used RV.

At age 70 she retired. She switched to her own SS retirement benefits. She moved into the RV and rented out her house. She then spent the next few years on the road travelling. She visited every state, and most of Canada. She caught up with friends and family all over the country. [She kept a blog about how she did it](https://sailingdowntheroad.blogspot.com/). And how she travelled on such a tight budget.

The keys were planning and keeping it simple. In her 60’s while working part time she did a lot of homework on how to do this RV trip. When she hit the road at age 70, she was ready to go. This RV trip in retirement is worth a separate thread.

**Combining Households**

My wife and I live and work in San Diego. Around 2016 we were looking to upgrade into a house or larger home from the condo we were living in. So, I proposed a plan to my mother. I suggested that we create a multi-generational household for us. That we combine forces and buy a home that is large enough for all of us. It would allow us to help her as she aged. It would allow her to help us buy a home in expensive San Diego. And it would allow her to have housing without the stress of rent or ownership.

She sold her house in Arizona and gifted me the money as part of the down payment. We sold our homes. And that gave us a large enough downpayment that we were able to shop and compete for homes in an expensive market that met our requirements. It was not easy. But we finally found the perfect house in Encinitas. It is in coastal San Diego County. It has ground floor granny unit. 4 bedroom/3 bath. Walking distance to the beach and downtown Encinitas. Close the hospital, medical, shopping, library, restaurants, and everything my mom could want.

We bought the house. Mom has lived with us for several years now. She still has her RV. I found a house a mile away that has an RV parking pad that they rented to her. She still takes RV trips, but shorter ones. Usually less than 2 months.

**How it works for her**

For her, she doesn’t have any housing expenses. We don’t charge her for any utilities. We all agreed that her contribution to the downpayment entitled her to a place to live for life. It is not like it costs us a lot because she lives here. The internet bill would be the same. The water and gas would be about the same. I had solar installed, so our electric bill is only about $10 a month. It is not worth bothering her about something that small.

Her health has started to decline since he hit 80. Her arthritis prevents her from doing a lot of things on her own now. Living with us allows us to help her. I make her bed because she can no longer do it herself. We do her laundry because she struggles climbing the stairs to the second floor. I take care of her car and her RV when things need to be fixed. I take care of her laptop and iPad and phone. When she is sick or not feeling well, we have dinner ready for her.

Her life here with us seems pleasant. She has a group of friends she sees regularly. She has own private bedroom and bathroom in the house that we respect. It’s her home. Her space. It’s off the side, like a granny unit. Her and her dog live there.  We have a little park at the end of the block where she likes to take her dog too.

A few blocks away is a larger park with a dog park. She loves the library, which is a few blocks away. And the senior center is not far either. She will meet her friends downtown for lunch. Or take herself to the beach.

The train station is very close to the house. I’ve tried teaching her how to use it. She could take to train to downtown San Diego, Orange County, Los Angeles. But she struggles to master it.

Her only complaint about living with us is that it is cold here. Because she is on the ground floor, and it is often foggy in the mornings being this close to the beach, it never gets hot here at our house. I put a heater in her room to help with this.

**How it works for us**

It is a win for us too. We have a live in house sitter and pet sitter for when we travel. That is a great relief for us because it allows us freedom without worrying about our pets at home. She cooks dinner once a week, which is great. She is a good cook. It gives my wife a break. And we enjoy what she creates. She takes care of our garden for us because she loves gardening. I hate gardening. I don’t mind at all.

A couple of times a month we have a movie night in the living room. We will pick a movie we all want to see. I will make popcorn for everyone. It’s nice to have these new traditions.

And we have a free airport shuttle, as long as it is daylight hours. She doesn’t drive at night anymore.

It is a win for my siblings too. They live in other states. Neither of them is able to have our mom live with them if she needs to be looked after. They are very happy that she is living here with us and that she is looked after and safe.

**Why This Works**

This works for us because we have some factors that are aligned in our favor. So obviously what works here won't work for everyone.

* My mother is not married or in a relationship. I don't think that this would work as well if it were a couple living in the granny unit. In a house this size it would require a detached granny unit.
* My wife and my mother get along. They have their differences of course. But my wife loves my mom. And my mom loves my wife. They respect each other. If you don't have that, then this can't work.
* There are no toxic addictions poisoning relationships. No one is getting drunk, high, stoned, and causing chaos at our house. It's hard to live with someone who has an addiction.
* My siblings are onboard with the arrangement. My mother invested their inheritance into our house. They are okay with that because they each own their own homes. I've planned to pay them their share after mom's death from equity and our savings. We put that in writing before we bought the house, with a payment schedule. I can get into details on how I made that work in another post. It's a bit complicated. But it can work.

**Her budget:**

**Healthcare:** She pays for Medicare Part B. She pays for supplemental insurance. She pays for Part D. All up, I think this costs her around $500 a month.

**Rent.** She does pay some rent. But not to us.

Storage Unit - $100 a month.

When she sold her house, she downsized from a home, into one bedroom and bathroom. That meant a lifetime of stuff that she had to do something with. Because she had rented her house out in Arizona when she took off in her RV, most of it went into storage. Later the rest of it went into storge when she sold the house.

Years later, most of it is gone. Sold, donated, or trashed. But there is still more to sort through. She has a rental space down the road. I bring her boxes to sort through from it about once a month and she slowly makes decisions on things.

RV parking pad- $100 a month

**Dog:** She has a dog that she spoils. I have no idea. Between dog food, treats, toys, vet bills, etc. $1M a month? I’m kidding. I’d guess $200 a month. I don’t know exactly. I just see lots of boxes from Chewy on the doorstep every week and a very happy dog.

**Cars**: She has a car and the RV. Between fuel, insurance, and registration, I guess this costs her about $150 a month.

**Entertainment:** She pays for a couple of TV streaming services. About $30 a month.

**Cellular Service:** $10 a month. She is on my family plan.

**Dining:** She likes to have lunch with her friends at least once or twice a week. $250 a month?

**Groceries:** $150 maybe? She rarely buys groceries. My wife and I always cook enough for all of us. We don’t even think about it. My wife doesn't work outside the home. And is an excellent cook. She makes most of our meals at home from scratch as healthy as she can. And I BBQ too. So it is no problem cooking for the whole family.

My mom harvests fruit and vegetables from our backyard garden that she maintains. We are grateful for that. I don't mind doing the heavy lifting for her, such as moving bags of topsoil, heavy potted plants. Or climbing the trees to harvest the oranges and figs.

**Travel:** This is her fun money. Whatever is left goes to travel. She goes on RV trips. She flies to Hawaii & Alaska. She has been on some cruises. Lately, her and her sister have been taking river cruises. They did the Columbia River last year.",post,69,0.99,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingOnSS/comments/1jhc6nh/how_my_mom_thrives_on_her_ss_of_1900_a_month_in_a/,Chewy
248,Chewy,chewy vet,1k7dn6t,N/A,2025-04-25,"Behavioral euthanasia for a dog. Longtime lurker here.

This is going to be a NOVEL, so here’s a TL;DR ahead of the post: Great Dane has been terrorizing our older dog for years. Tonight was another bloody fight and I’m so scared my sweet little girls could end up injured or worse if they get caught in the middle one day. We’ve exhausted all our options and are now considering behavioral euthanasia. Feeling like a bad person for even letting it cross my mind but struggling to come up with any other solution 💔

-

I have two girls - a 2yo and a 5mo. I also have 3 dogs. One of which is a Great Dane. He is the biggest asshole on the planet but we’ve loved him since day one. He started fighting with our older dog maybe 9 months after we got him in 2021. These are intense and bloody fights. We’ve been walking on eggshells for years, wondering when the next fight would happen. They’ve typically been every ~6 months but the most recent one had been maybe 2 or 3 months ago and then there was another tonight. We have a girl dog who’s older than him but he’s scared of her lol so there’s no problem between them. She definitely rules the roost.

I’m absolutely sick over this. We’ve contacted his breeder and asked her to take him back. She will not. I’ve asked every rescue and sanctuary I could find, Great Dane-specific and not. No one will take him due to his behavior toward my other dog. His bite history is pretty bad when it comes to our older dog. He’s left deep puncture wounds, ripped his ears, bloodied his eye, nearly broke bones in his paws. Even our local humane society said hell no to him. I’ve posted him on Facebook (asking for a rehoming fee and vet check), specifying he’s dog-aggressive and would need to be the only pet in a home. No one is interested in a 160lb dog who’s wounded another animal many times.

We’ve tried trainers, medication, a behavioral specialist. The latter actually came to our home 2 years ago to observe the dogs together and within 30 minutes very confidently told us they would never be able to live together happily. Our Great Dane just bullies our older dog nonstop. No amount of time or money spent on him has helped. Our dogs can’t have treats because of the potential for a fight. They can’t have bones or chewy toys. They have no enrichment because it sets our Great Dane on edge and causes him to act aggressive toward our older dog. And now with our extremely needy 5mo, we would have no time to dedicate to attempting training him again. I can’t even take a 15 minute shower without her screaming bloody murder for me.

I feel we’re trapped. We can’t keep them separate. We don’t have the space and it’s unfair to deprive one dog or the other from family time. I don’t have the time to split between them. And honestly? I don’t fucking want to deal with him anymore. It’s been years of waiting and wondering when it’ll happen again. Getting lulled into a false sense of “maybe that was the last time and everything is cool now”. I just want to be done with him. After tonight, I’m terrified of the idea of my girls accidentally getting caught in the middle of a fight. Our dogs LOVE the girls, even our Great Dane. They’re exceptionally gentle and affectionate toward them. Of course they’re literally never left alone near the kids ever under any circumstances, but now especially, it makes me wonder what could happen in the future when they’re both 5+, roaming freely around the home without us capable of constantly watching. What if they would get stuck in the crossfire of a random, unpredictable fight? I cry just thinking about it.

So anyway. I’m calling the vet in the morning to discuss behavioral euthanasia. I’m guilt-ridden, heartbroken, and just destroyed over even considering it. But I truly feel out of options. My husband said it has to be done because no one is going to take him and even if they do, who’s to say he’ll never come across another dog and kill it? I’m sure the only reason our other dog is still alive is because he’s also a large breed and very sturdy. One little bite from a Great Dane could kill a smaller dog in a split second. That would make me feel even guiltier.

I don’t know why I’m posting here. I guess because no one will (hopefully) judge me too much. I have no one else to talk to besides my mom. She has witnessed two of their fights, including tonight’s, and told me he needs to go immediately.

Anyway. I’m going to stay awake all night crying while nursing my baby and comforting my injured older dog. Am I a terrible person for considering behavioral euthanasia?

EDIT: We said goodbye to our boy today around 1:30pm. I am completely heartbroken and have been crying all day. Thank you to everyone for your very kind replies. I’ve been questioning whether we did the right thing and reading through the responses here has made me feel just a slight bit better, although I don’t think I’ll ever get over this or forgive myself. We made his last afternoon as special as we could and the vet staff was extremely kind and understanding. Thank you all again ❤️‍🩹",post,77,0.96,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1k7dn6t/behavioral_euthanasia_for_a_dog/,Chewy

His normal vet told me what to look out for and what the bad signs are: cluster seizures, ones that last more than 2 minutes, high frequency, etc. but if your pup has had seizures I’d love to hear your experience: how do you manage them, what do you do while it’s happening, if they take medication, if that works, if they stopped eventually or if they got worse. And anything else you can add!

My last cattle dog lived to be 15 without any health problems at all so this is very surprising for me. He’s a great boy!

250,Chewy,chewy vet,1fq9kws,N/A,2024-09-26,"Royal Canin Issue? So, my cats have been eating Hydrolyzed Protein dry kibble for 1.5 years without issue until shortly after I bought a new bag in August from Chewy. Something seemed 'off' but I didn't have any of the old kibble to compare. My cats seemed a little less enthusiastic about eating it but they did. 

Long story short is that it seems to have made both of my cats sick but we didn't pin it on the food at first because they got sick at different times and one has health issues with IBD/IBS already. Around the time one cat stopped eating for 4 days I had to force feed her and take her to the vet, the other began vomiting. It clicked maybe the food may be the issue after her vet exam and labs came back clean ($800). 

I bought a new bag which came today and the kibble is notably different by sight and smell. This is frustrating and worrisome since this is an expensive medically prescribed product.

I've already sent Royal Canin an email but wanted to ask, has anyone else has had an issue like this recently? 

Does Royal Canin use the same shape for their different kibble formulas? I tried them on the Selected Protein PR before the Hydrolyzed and feel it was a different shape. Just trying to figure out if the wrong product was put into the Hydrolyzed bag. ",post,23,0.78,109,https://i.redd.it/fc6m47jmi8rd1.jpeg,Chewy
251,Chewy,chewy vet,1koufrx,N/A,2025-05-17,"What's the cheapest quality vet care for a cat you've found in south Philly? I was going to Companion Pet Hospital for a number of years. Last year I moved within walking distance to City Cat Vet so I switched. I like both and appreciate that City Cats is cats only. 

I'm still entrenched in the worst financial year (over a year now) of my life and struggling to get by. Naturally, my cat was just diagnosed with a hyperthyroid which will need lifelong meds and, at least, biannual visits to monitor him. I can work some magic to afford the $7 monthly generic meds on chewy but I 100% cannot afford two $375 vet bills a year, not including *any* of his other care or emergency visits. 

My mother, who lives in south jersey. Said $375 sounded a little high. I know places are more expensive in the city and I obviously want the best for me cat and have been willing to go into more debt bringing him somewhere highly rated but...the money simply does not exist and it will not. Not next week, nor the week after that. I considered rehoming him to a family who can better care for his senior needs but after ten years with him I just can't do it. 

He is my literal best friend and I'm mainly all he knows. I can't do that. I don't want to change vets but need to be realistic about my budget and unstable financial future. I wish I could give him the best without a second thought to cost but that's not my life. So I'm hoping to hear from other cat owners on a painfully strict budget in south philly where you take your pets, especially if you've dealt with hyperthyroid related treatment and bills there. 

Edit: Thanks for the recommendations everyone. I'll be looking into them this coming week. Also want to reiterate that both Companion and City Cats are awesome, just currently out of my price range!

252,Chewy,chewy vet,1jvas1z,N/A,2025-04-09,"Bandit Update Trying this again as apparent none of the pictures worked on the previous post?


I'm copy pasting some of this from the most recent GoFundMe update. I won't be posting the GoFundMe as the mods seemed weird about it last time, some saying it was fine, others not, you can find that on your own if you want to donate, or you can DM me for it.  


I was asked to update with information on what's going on with Bandit after the last post a month or so ago. So here goes.  
   
  
He was brought into an emergency vet early in March that I hadn't done my research on (I was in a panic) and found out they're notorious for overcharging. They wanted 12,500 to begin any sort of treatment from Bandit. I couldn't afford that, went into the lobby to get the original post and GoFundMe started. I took him home that night, and thought I was watching him die, so I did as recommended and called two other places to get second opinions. One place would begin treatment with only 75% down, and I brought him there the following day. I didn't qualify for loans or Carecredit so I had to get even that amount loaned to me from someone I know IRL while the GFM spun up.  


That day and the following day he received his blood transfusion, an iron test, some imaging test of some sort to check for ulcers and such, he had fluid in his abdomen that they extracted and sent for testing, and he began a treatment plan of prednisone and doxycycline. I admit I fucked up here and misunderstood what they meant when they doubled his dosage of prednisone, I thought they doubled the dosage of the pills themselves, I was supposed to be giving him twice the amount.  
 

He came home and did well for a while, and all the tests came back inconclusive. The next step was a bone marrow biopsy, he went in for that, did well, came out and was able to come home. At that point I was told him blood cell count was holding what it was the night of the transfusion before I brought him home (14%)  


The following week I fought with myself about whether he was doing well or not. I couldn't trust myself (this is three weeks of fucked up sleep and pretty much permanent panic) about what the color his tongue was and whether his energy levels seemed the same or different, he just had part of his bone removed after all, of course his he's not gonna be energetic. At this point his poops I will say were pale in color and very not solid, which should have been an indicator but he was on so many medicines and I was so unsure if I could trust myself. By the end of the week he was refusing chicken, and that was not normal, so off to the vet we went again, they did a blood draw while I was there and determined he needed another blood transfusion, and they said they were going to put him on another medication, cyclosporine, to suppress his immune system as they had seen, but could not confirm without the biopsy, that in the aspirate he seemed to be beginning the process of making red blood cells.  


He came home the following day, which was last week... Something. The days are blending together. 

  
Then I got the call from the vet yesterday, I didn't want to update yesterday for some reason, maybe I was afraid I was dreaming and would wake up.  Along with prednisone and cyclosporine he is still taking doxycycline (an antibiotic) that he'll be finishing tomorrow and he was put on cerenia for nausea, I think.  
  
  
Yesterday they said that they received his results from the bone marrow biopsy and they corroborated what the aspirate said, he was beginning to produce his red blood cells but they were being destroyed somewhere along the way. The doctor said that the treatment he was started on post blood transfusion is appropriate for treating this, and he'll continue this medication for the foreseeable future. There is a possibility he may need another blood transfusion if he doesn't respond right away, and at this point my credit cards are maxed except one that has $100 left and we've exceeded the funds gotten by the GoFundMe. I'm just increasing our goal to cover the possibility of the blood transfusion, and if he doesn't need it the funds will be to cover his medicine. The cyclosporine from the hospital is $112 per 7.5 day dose, $65 from Chewy, which is considerably more manageable.   
  
  
His diagnosis is Precursor-targeted Immune Mediated Anemia. He seems to be responding to the medication currently, but at this point it's important to be prepared in case he needs the blood transfusion. They're unsure what caused him to develop it but it is an autoimmune disease and sometimes you just don't know with those.  


I want to end this on a positive note though, yesterday we went on two full walks, one one block in the morning, his poops are the correct color and are relatively solid, and at night, we went on two blocks at his insistence. He also walks down the stairs when we go outside, and will try to walk up the stairs when we get back but that might still be too much for his leg where he got the biopsy as he gets up one and a half flights, but I don't mind carrying him the rest. He's playful, I caught him playing with a toy, very briefly I think, I got him in to briefly chase a long piece of packaging paper, he tried to jump on the bed last night, he chirps at me to get up and walk him in the morning, he insists he's too good to eat just kibble now, he requires kibble, chicken and cheese in his daily rotation, he got ground turkey yesterday instead of chicken and was more than excited to perform tricks to obtain it, even trotting with great speed when I called him over. When we're walking his seems to have more energy, frequently walking ahead of me like he used to.   
  
  
Thank you again to everyone for all of your help, donations, sharing the GoFundMe, assisting with getting Bandit to and from the vet the many times we've gone, and the many other ways people have helped. Hopefully we reach this last stretch goal soon, and even if not, I look forward to telling everyone about Bandit's progress.

I submitted my request through Chewy for their tick/flea preventative and routed it through the new vet.

It is quite late where I live so I will be reading through and responding tomorrow. Baby still hasn’t eaten, we have offered chicken liver, boiled chicken breast, tuna for the cats, cat kibble, cat paste, dog biscuits (plain and chicken liver ones), pumpkin peanutbutter treats, butternut, pumpkin, mcdonalds chicken patty, mcdonalds beef patty and dried venison sausage (it’s like beef jerky almost but made from antelope). Most of this she normally eats or even loves, but the only thing she took now, even though she has never actually had it before, was the beef patty. I am well aware that it isn’t ideal but we are at our wits end. She literally sniffles the patty, bites a piece off, drops it on the floor, bites another piece off, drops it on the floor, and so on, without actually eating anything. Will be trying bread tomorrow morning and see how that goes. She is still drinking fortunately, so at least that is good. We did a short, slow walk as well, just through the street, and she loved it, but still didn’t eat afterwards. If she’s not eating by monday she will have to be hospitalised because then it has been a week :(

Hi, I am new to the sub, but desperate. I’ve been lurking and trying to find anyone in a similar situation or with similar experiences.

Our 8 month old female husky was spayed on monday (3 March). She ate normal dinner before the spay, and essentially hasn’t eaten properly since. Over the past week we have tried to offer her anything we can to get her to eat. Being nauseous for 1-2 days we can understand, but for the whole week seems excessive. She has eaten a cooked chicken fillet, 2 chewy sticks and 2 small packets of wet cat food since Sunday. We have offered healthy food that she normally loves, unhealthy food (like chicken nuggets even), treats, etc. literally anything we can. We are desperate. 

She is interested and sniffles the food. Sometimes she puts it in her mouth and then drops it. When opening a treat packet she also looks interested but refuses to eat.

Before the whole ordeal she was a fussy eater, and she would definitely wait for my mom to mix canned cat tuna through her dry kibble before eating it, but she now hasn’t eaten any kibble for a week. We’ve offered chicken livers, chicken breast, mince, pumpkin, sausage things, tiny slice of hotdog, etc. she refuses it all. 

We have taken her to the vet, today also, who thinks it might be food aversion, due to emotional stress, from going to the vet to be spayed and then on Wednesday she felt very cold so she also went to the vet and had to stay there. So the vet today said maybe it is emotional. She has also been very anxious, running away from my mom, etc. and hasn’t been walked properly. She is used to 2x a day 1h walk, but it wasn’t allowed because of the surgery. 

So the vet gave antibiotics and pain injection, because she hasn’t been eating so we haven’t been able to give her pills. Then she also gave valium for the anxiety and to hopefully increase appetite, so she got her first valium earlier today, still not eating or taking treats etc. 

We are so worried about her and I just wanted to see if anyone else has been through similar situations or has any other theories of what we can try or what this can be? We are really so desperate and my mom has been crying already because we lost 3 animals last year and we don’t want to lose our little girl.",post,43,0.91,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/husky/comments/1j6mkyc/8mo_female_starving_herself_to_death_help/,Chewy
256,Chewy,chewy vet,1dm0mcu,N/A,2024-06-22,"My cat has a chest tube Hi! This is my first time posting here. I think this a bit of an unusual situation so I wanted to share it with you all. I am marking this as uplifting, because I view it that way, but it’s not completely positive.  

My cat Echo is almost 16 and has both heart failure and newly diagnosed kidney disease. He was diagnosed with heart failure last year in June and had to be hospitalized for a few days for pulmonary edema. He recovered great and continued to do well, our vet said he didn’t need to continue on medication as he was stable. (He probably should have stayed on meds but oh well)

Last month on May 6th he had an episode of respiratory distress requiring hospitalization, and was found to have pleural effusions this time (fluid between the lung and pleural cavity) as well as pulmonary edema. He was also newly diagnosed with kidney disease despite his labs being perfect just two weeks prior. He had just had his yearly checkup including an echocardiogram and everything looked good. 

After the three day hospitalization where they did two thoracentesises we met with a cardiologist to have an echocardiogram done, he told us his presentation isn’t typical for cats, he has valve damage but it isn’t degenerative. The theory is he likely had a blood clot when he had his leg amputated many years ago that caused damage to his heart. We discussed treatment but basically he said his condition is very poor and little will likely work, we could have days to weeks. He has both congestive and restrictive heart failure as well as pulmonary hypertension. He had a lot of fluid around his heart and lungs and it would continue to come back. 

Thankfully we got all of his care in Tijuana, and they offered us the option of placing an indwelling chest tube that I could manually remove fluid at home. I have never heard of that being done in the US. I am sure it is cost prohibitive, and high liability to send them home with one. It is a palliative treatment, it won’t cure anything, but drowning alive is no way to die.

On May 29th I noticed he was a bit heavier and seemed to be breathing a bit worse so I decided it was time for the chest tube. They ended up taking 220mls of fluid off! That’s a ton considering he weighs 6.5lbs. 

He has now had his chest tube for a bit over three weeks and is doing amazing! He is eating and drinking, purring and being social. He is usually very picky but loves his new kidney diet. I have started him on kidney supplements and of course phosphorus binder. 

I know we likely still have very little time left, but considering he’s stable and happy right now every little bit feels like a gift. 

I am an RN so taking care of his chest tube isn’t too bad. We clean it with Chlorhexidine daily, put a drain gauze there, and wrap him up. He doesn’t mind the tube or having to wear T-shirts haha. I’ve found I need to wrap him a bit at his belly as well or the fluid will start to accumulate there as well. I drain his tube about twice a day and it’s still putting out a lot. About 30-60ml a day. He doesn’t love that because it’s a bit positional so I have to squeeze him a bit to try and move the pockets of fluid around hahaha. We may try another diuretic but it’s hard because of the kidney disease. 

Fun fact, most cats have a channel between their lungs unlike humans so you can drain the fluid from both sides even with just one tube.  

He takes meds twice a day, no problem with a pill shooter. Thankfully the ones from chewy are all tiny so I place them in one little chicken flavored capsule to make it easy. He takes Lasix for the fluid, Sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, Pimobendan for heart failure, and plavix for cardiac hypertrophy. 

I wanted to share his story with you all, as I find it rather interesting, but also to express how grateful I am to have extra time with him. Standard in the US would be euthanasia for this situation, but even when he wasn’t doing well, he was always happy, and he def wasn’t ready to go.

It seems like a lot of work/stress, but really it’s only a few minutes out of every day. I’m just so grateful to be able to have this time with him, I know it’s extremely limited, and I’m thankful in a way to be able to know that his time is coming to an end. I’m able to be completely present with him, and cherish every moment. He is allowed to do anything he wants haha. He gets plenty of churus, he gets to try a bite of all my food, and if he doesn’t want to come out from under the bed for his meds-hey that’s his right. 

I am also very grateful to have gotten his veterinary care in Mexico. His three day hospitalization was $684, his cardiologist was $225 and his chest tube placement and one night hospital sptial stay was $590. His last follow up appt was $8. We do not live very close to Tijuana so it was a struggle making so many trips but very worth it. We both lived in central Mexico for the last two years before this so it was a no brainer. Including all of his meds, food, supplies we are still under $2k for all of this. While that is very expensive, it doesn’t come close to the cost in the US. I would not be able to have made these choices if we didn’t have the option to go to Tijuana. He is also a very well behaved cat, and being a nurse his care is much more manageable than it would be for most.

I know this story isn’t exactly positive, I still wish he could live to be 22, but 16 years is a good life. He’s so happy and doing so well right now, he’s pain free and if any of that changes I will of course prioritize his comfort. But I can say I truly did everything I could. I love my little hospice baby, and I feel privileged to be able to take care of him and have this time with him.

My furry friend has just recently been diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy, and our vet prescribed phenobarbital to help control her seizures. The catch is that our vet doesn’t carry the phenobarbital, so we need to take the prescription and find it elsewhere. I’m really struggling to find this stuff. I stupidly assumed I’d be able to get it through Chewy no problem. I’m only finding it on PetMeds, sold by the individual tablet??

I came across a post that others have actually been able to get their dog phenobarbital from cvs, Walgreens, etc. This is awesome news to me, but I am so confused…how did ya’ll do it? Do I just walk into this human pharmacy with my dog’s prescription and ask them to fill it without batting an eyelash? I’m so confused. I just never realized these places would accept veterinary prescriptions? I’m also assuming now that the drug is the same whether intended for human or canine consumption? In other words, there isn’t a veterinary specific version?

Nuts are a major allergen. I don't understand how a large company could make such a wreckless, negligent decision to add a major allergen to medications for ailing pets, some with weakened immune systems.

My cat got sick after her most recent bottle of medication. I called customer service to ask if the formula had changed and was originally told no, Chewy wouldn't change the formula without informing customers. The next day, a Chewy pharmacist called to tell me that the formula HAS changed for ALL of their oral compounded medications. They now include almond oil. I'm so thankful to this pharmacist for being honest. 

I hope others don't have issues with the change as I have, but please, if you do, contact Chewy about it. Hopefully they will go back to the old formula if they receive enough complaints.

In the past few months there has been a striking up tick in the number of patients reporting that they’re taking ivermectin and/or mebendazole for their cancer.

On the off chance it is being prescribed… Are any of you in outpatient pharmacies actually seeing scripts for ivermectin and mebendazole?? And if so… does the dose match the indication (assuming they’re putting an indication of a helminth infection they don’t have since “cancer” isn’t a valid indication)?

My husband and I both work a lot of hours and have a toddler, so we are looking for ways to reduce consumption that are not extremely time intensive. Examples of things we have done so far: 

- stopped random target trips for stuff we don’t need. 
- we don’t buy seasonal decor, candles, holiday themed stuff (and never really did) 
- we try to meal prep and avoid food waste by planning our meals and sticking to a list. We still order 1-2 days a week. 
- we utilize our town’s buy nothing group to donate things we have outgrown and also pick up stuff for our toddler. 
- no online browsing - we buy with intention when we actually need something. 
- cut back on some streaming services. We share the rest with my family. 

But, it still feels like we consume a lot. Most months we have packages coming at least twice a week between Chewy (for the dog), diaper subscription, medication, household essentials (this week it was light bulbs and caulk for our bathroom) and cleaning products that we actually go through each month, etc. We also still have to utilize dry cleaning, grocery pickup, and other services. We get hand me downs for our toddler from her cousins, but end up needing to buy some stuff each season. 

Are there other “easy” things we can do? How are people with kids reducing consumption? It feels impossible. I just don’t have the time to go to a local pharmacy, hardware store, or find whatever else I need from a place that’s not online.

My dog's allergies have gotten *so bad* this year that not only is he taking Zyrtec once a day, but now Apoquel too (he itched himself into a small skin infection). UGH. For reference, he's about 30lbs.

Does anybody else here have to give their dog Apoquel? That stuff is obscenely expensive; even at Costco it's $82/mo, but I can't just let him itch himself raw that's wrong. It seems to be wholly environmental because he doesn't have it during the winter, even when winter is mild.

I'm either looking for cheaper alternatives or the vet suggested every other day, but I'm afraid that won't work and he'll still itch himself senseless the off days - he's miserable without.

I thought maybe I could get the 16mg and cut them in half but the vet said that's too much medicine based on his weight, so I'm stuck buying the 5.4mg tablets.

I've looked at Chewy's pharmacy, Kroger doesn't carry it, Costco is still $82 and the vet is no cheaper. Maybe I'll only have to give it during the spring / fall months? This is uncharted territory for me and I'm hoping someone else local to the area, has thoughts on the situation.

The correct dose of Benadryl (25mg/2-3x a day) knocks him out cold and a half dose doesn't do nearly enough, so that's a no go unfortunately.


TIA!

My dog was recently diagnosed with a perianal fistula, and we are being told his medication will cost $240 dollars a month. The same medications are on Chewy Pharmacy and other online pharmacies for a little over 100 dollars for the first order and 172 thereafter. We are struggling like everyone out there and just cannot afford the 240 a month. However, I would need three separate prescriptions and my vet is saying they will not prescribe written prescription and for every prescription refill from another pharmacy I’d have to pay my vet 20 dollars. Is this even allowed? I always thought pharmacy choice was allowed and encouraged. I feel like this is a cash grab and I’m just so stressed financially; we just put 600 dollars on credit to get his biopsy done to diagnose the fistula. 

Here’s the text message I got from the vet: 

If you would like to go through 3rd party pharmacies we do have to have you come in and sign the online prescription care waiver form. You would need to pay a $20 processing fee each time you would need a prescription refilled before it would get approved. We do not give written prescriptions but you can certainly put in a request for the medication.

EDIT: I don’t understand people fiercely defending this practice and downvoting people’s comments who aren’t favorable of it lol. It’s OKAY if I don’t want to spend an extra 60 dollars when I refill medication. That being said, I appreciate all the genuine advice. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE this vet practice and they are extremely kind, caring, and their prices are generally very fair. It’s okay for me to not like this one thing about them.

We brought our cats to the vet on Wednesday to get their yearly check up (rabies, distemper, physical).

we had noticed about maybe a month or so prior that my eight-year-old cat, smokes, had been losing weight and seemed skinnier than she should, and was also struggling to eat. We figured she had a couple problems with her teeth, but we also had her on diet food because we accidentally let her balloon up to 13 pounds . We then put her on diet food for about a year and a half so when she got down to around 7 pounds. We were like well, this is how much she weighed when we got her (she was four), so maybe we just forgot what skinny looked like because she was so chunky for a while, lol. We knew she had her yearly pet appointment coming up anyway, so we decided to wait.

when we did get her to the vet, they checked her teeth and said she had two that would need to be taken out. They said they wanted to do bloodwork because she was dehydrated, and they were going to have to screen her anyway before putting her under anesthesia for a tooth surgery. The next day they come back and tell us our cat is in stage for a kidney failure, cannot get tooth surgery, and we have a pharmacies worth of medicine right now and we are struggling to get her to take them.

she is currently on subcutaneous fluids twice a day – this has gotten better and does not seem to be a huge issue as long as we are bribing her with greenies. The chewy middle ones, to make it easier for her to eat. 

She was put on an antibiotic twice a day, for the teeth problem, but she has started not eating her pill pockets, and she is not receptive to a pill shooter, and we worry about prying, her mouth open, trying to get her to take it because of her teeth :-(

She does not like her prescription cat food. 

She is a nephrodyl once a day that we try mixing into her food. Yesterday we blended up her food into a puree and mixed it in and gave it to her via syringe (that she licked off, we didn’t have to hold her mouth open). She mostly hates it but again she fights anything regarding holding her mouth open for a pill shooter. 

she is also on the Rena plus gel, and if that is put in her food, she absolutely will not eat her food but again, we cannot get her to keep her mouth open and stop freaking out. If we mix it into her food, she will not eat it. 

I am freaking out. I cannot get her to eat her food or two or three of her medication‘s at any given time. It’s inconsistent every day. Today I was desperate enough to try purring her food and some greenies in the food processor hoping it would make her eat it. Did not work. 

I am hoping for any tips, we will do anything for her, but it’s like she can suss out whenever there’s a medication in her food and once she figures that out she will not eat it at all. On top of it, we have another cat that is fighting to try to eat her food because it smells better than her food but obviously she can’t eat it because there is medication in it. We are very overwhelmed and I am at my wits end already and I know we still have a long road ahead of us. ",post,43,0.96,27,https://i.redd.it/w7ibn3zosjee1.jpeg,Chewy

Just got back from a vet appointment for my 2 year old, extremely anxious cat Millie. She's started overgrooming and her anxious behaviors have gotten worse. After I had to push for actual anxiety medication (the other interventions she suggested haven't worked), the Vet suggested fluoxetine tablets. I was unfamiliar with the medication and asked more about it. The vet briefly explained that it is a SSRI for cats. I explained that it is extremely hard to administer oral medication and asked if there is a topical option. She replied that no, she wasn't aware of anything like that. I asked her to clarify again, and she confirmed that she is unaware of any options that aren't oral. She prescribed the tablet form for me to order from their online pharmacy.

After repeated attempts by our vet to slander Chewy and get us to purchase Rx flea preventative from their (more expensive) in-house pharmacy, and weeks of back & forth - we finally got them to give us a paper script to send to Chewy. Surprise! My name is spelled wrong. It's the same first name, just a different spelling (example: Stephen vs Steven). All other info is correct. Another fun surprise, vet is out of town for a week! I can't really wait another week+ for them to get this corrected script to me. 

I'm also afraid our vet, who didn't want us to go to Chewy in the first place, is going to be fed up with writing multiple scripts and give me a reason why they can't/won't. This will be the fourth one. When we first asked them to write us a physical script I asked specifically to have it put in my name, not my partner's name (who is the primary on our vet acct) as my name is the one on the Chewy account, so I needed it in my name to match Chewy. They wrote the script in partner's name anyway. I go to pick it up, ""hey actually I needed this in my name, as I stated initially"", ""ok no worries, we'll fix it and call you when it's ready!"". Next day I get a voicemail from the vet's office ""Hi I'm understanding you needed another script but I'm seeing here we already gave one to you? Please call us back to clarify"", then an hour later another voicemail ""Hi disregard last message, your script is ready!"" so I'm thinking okay they figured it out. Go to pick it up, AGAIN it's in my partner's name. I explain once again - this needs to be in my name, that's why I needed the FIRST one replaced. FINALLY I go today to pick it up and it's in my name but spelled incorrectly. And can't get a corrected one for at least a week. Every time I've picked up a new script I have exchanged it for the one they gave me prior, so I'm not just stacking prescriptions over here.

So I'm ready to just send it and take my chances. Anyone had experience with misspelled info on scripts to Chewy? I'm wondering if they'll be super strict about the spelling or if someone will have the common sense to understand it shouldn't be a huge deal as the address and all other info match.

I received a condolence message personal to Mandie of significant length. I was assured everything was cancelled. I was credited for the fluids that shipped even though I didn’t ask. I cried. (Of course) 

I wish the whole world could be as compassionate and eager to help as Chewy customer service. And, it must be a lovely place to work. Life is a mirror, you get what you put out.

I try to time my orders from chewy.com and wait until a good shopping portal offer comes along simultaneously with a sale at chewy.com for what i need.

I dont autoship from chewy because of this.

I used to use capital one rewards more, but recently i have changed to using the capital one shopping portal more (yes, this is different).  If you get the browser extension and turn it on when you shop at chewy.com, leave the items in your cart, turn the extension off,  and the next day you will often get an email from capital one shopping for 30% off at chewy.  Click on that link and make your purchase.  If you get the 30% off email, its better than anything youll get on capital one rewards.  

Capital one shopping also has its basic rewards system that fluctuates between around 2-10% back.  If im not getting a special email offer, then i compare the base offers from capital one shopping and capital one rewards before making my purchase.  

Often, chewy puts items on sale for 20-50% off, or they do the ‘spend $100 get a $30 gift card’ promo, so If you can stack a chewy.com sale, with a capital one shopping 30% off order, + whatever credit card reward (4.5% for apple pay with USBAR is my go to), we are talking over 50% off.",comment,3,,,https://reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1htpjz2/capital_one_rewards_chewycom/m5fkfx0/,Chewy

1st post be gentle  

  

Chewy.com has a great deal going on right now and they all stack together  

  

- Lots of items are on sale - great deals alone  

- Free shipping > $35 pre-discount  

- %35 off 1st autoship purchase (up to $20 off max) Choose 8 months away and cancel later  

- Buy 3 get 1 free  

- Free $20 E-Gift Card > spend over $49 (pre-discount which is nice)  

  

Our GSD loves frisbees and we go through them often. Heres an example of my order  

  

Quanity x 1 : Hyperflite K-10 HyperFlex Disc Dog Toy, Purple $19.60 each  

Quanity x 3 : Chuckit! Paraflight Dog Toy, Large $9.98 each  

  

Items (5): $49.54  

Flat-Rate Shipping: FREE  

Buy 3, get 4th free- mix & match (discount -$9.98)  

35% Off First Autoship Order. (discount -$13.85)  

Will email you the free $20 E-Gift Card after your order ships (enter promo code #Welcome)  

Total Before Tax: $25.71  

  

Hopefully I can use that E-Gift card to create a new account with my wifes info and repeat the order only paying $5.71 + tax for the same items to have plenty of extra frisbees for currency. Will update this post when I know.  

  

Hope this helps someone. If so please share your deal. The only negative thing is the 3+1 deal only gives you the lowest price item for free. But if you buy 3 items for $10 and a 4th for $20 it will take $10 off that item. Play around with it you will find a great deal!!

Whimsy's Menagerie has the best deal on sticks as they price per pound instead of per stick. Most of my toys came from there as well.  [Whimsy's](https://www.whimsysmenagerie.com/sticks-stones)


>Favorite chin dust? Currently using Every Yay, it's what came with him and seemed fine to use it up, but if there is one people like better I'm all ears! 


I really like chilldust! It's finer than other brands and I feel like my chins are somehow softer with it. [Chilldust](https://chilldust.com/)

>Timothy Hay? Currently have oxbow and he seems to like it fine. Should I stick with that? 


Oxbow is fine. I switched to small pet select recently. You can get both on Chewy. 


>2 of his ledges came with plastic food bowls. Those went to Goodwill immediately, but now his bowl doesn't fit. Is there a bowl someone can recomend or should I just sand the hole until it fits? It's close but raised up enough that when it's empty he flips it out onto the bottom of the cage 🤣 this one saws chew resistant?

396,Chewy,chewy vet,mp3jfcj,1k82pp7,2025-04-26,"This is such an outdated myth that it’s honestly infuriating that so many vet med staff continue to use it as an excuse to refuse to work with online pharmacies. Like 10+ years ago there was concern that Chewy and 1-800-Pet-Meds were selling shady gray market stuff. That’s no longer the case. Chewy pharmacies are licensed and accredited. Some docs don’t like that they sell compounded prescription medications, but they use all FDA approved ingredients for compounded medications (the same as human pharmacies). Also, at Chewy you have the benefit of a licensed pharmacist reviewing your order at multiple different points, vs. most clinics where an assistant with sometimes only a few months of experience fills your order. 

The real issue here is that (a) clinics don’t like losing money to pharmacies like Chewy and (b) it creates  another task to approve orders through online pharmacies. In my experience, the clinics that embrace working with online pet pharmacies have a smooth experience; the ones who are reluctant or resentful tend to have issues because they don’t bother learning how it works.

AVMA ethics, and some state laws, require your veterinarian to provide a written script. You can fill it at a human pharmacy like Costco as others have mentioned, or you could mail it in to Chewy. Doing that every month would be a pain, but I believe you can mail multiple prescriptions at once. Also, your vet can write for a higher number of pills/tablets/mls and Chewy will keep that on record and allow you to order monthly or by whatever frequency works for you. If your vet refuses to do even that, you need to decide if you’re okay with that. It would personally be a dealbreaker for me as I order multiple medications every month for my dog, but if you’re willing to take the hit because you only need preventatives a couple times a year and really like your vet, that’s reasonable too.",comment,13,,,https://reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1k82pp7/vet_is_no_longer_filling_prescriptions_from_chewy/mp3jfcj/,Chewy

408,Chewy,chewy vet,mmg5g39,1jw3d84,2025-04-10,"Have been a Chewy auto-delivery customer for nearly 9 years. The reason I order almost exclusively pouch food for my cats is due to frequent can damage caused by FedEx. I even had 2 of those 17-lb. plastic buckets of Tidy Cat litter pop @ the strap around the top in transit. Those straps require brute force to remove by hand, so I have no idea how FedEx got them to snap in transit, TWO separate times. The litter was all over the inside of my delivery box & spilled everywhere when I opened the carton. Dented cans were worrisome enough (as the seal may be broken, but not overtly visible) but when I found a burst can of food in one carton, that had rotted, stank, & seeped through the carton onto my wood floor, & found one of my cats licking @ the seepage, I was done. I  asked to cancel my account but the rep was masterful @ attempting to fix it. I also got the bright idea of switching to pouch food, but it IS more expensive. While it is not Chewy's fault, & they do indeed have a generous replacement policy, they continue to use FedEx as a carrier, as do most of the online pet supply vendors (so even if you switch vendors, they'll likely still be using FedEx). FedEx is guilty of numerous poor practices. I have lost count of the # of complaints Chewy has filed w/ FedEx on my behalf. Other than ordering smaller packages of 3-oz. canned food & other items, all I can suggest is ordering pouch food. Just be aware that many pouch foods are < 3 oz./pouch. I have not had any damaged pouches, & 24-packs, such as Merrick Backcountry (3 oz.), usually come in a sturdy cardboard carton taped shut. Some brands of pouch food in 12-packs, like Tiki Cat, come in thin, flimsy boxes that come open along their perforations, but individual pouches in these have not been damaged.",comment,7,,,https://reddit.com/r/catfood/comments/1jw3d84/damaged_cans_from_chewy/mmg5g39/,Chewy

413,Chewy,chewy pharmacy,m8okcyl,1i7b7d1,2025-01-23,"This is my first time ever posting, apologies to the mods if I violated any rules.

I made a promise to my kitties that I would post all our tips and tricks on Reddit, and it feels intimidating because sometimes the comments are upsetting and well I’m a sensitive soul. 

Tanya’s guide as mentioned by others below was an invaluable resource. Our approach was very proactive and we were scared like you bc we couldn’t stop the vomiting or coax them to eat. It’s high maintenance, it’s expensive, but we got our cats back to stage 2 from stage 3, and neither progressed past stage 2. Lived another 5 years, age 19). 

They went from being chonks to slightly underweight and once we got a rhythm they went back to being slightly overweight and maintained with the regimen below. I want to be clear, I am not a vet and you should consult with yours before doing any of the following. FYI, we decided to spend the $$ to see a renal specialist who wasn’t really much help and most of the info was the same as what the primary vet told us. Just our experience. Here was our regimen below, I’m sure through trial and error, you and your kitty will find a rhythm too:

1. Mirataz as others mentioned as appetite stimulant, instructions show you how to rub it on the ear but I found it helpful to ask the vet to show me. Make sure you use gloves, or your appetite will increase too.
2. Get purina hydra care specifically. Mix it into every meal. Ours loved it, and if I had to pick one thing, this was what kept them so hydrated.
3. Get Costco size cans of tuna. Open a little to pour out only the broth. Pour a little over each meal. Put the rest in the fridge, it’s good for a day or two.

3a. Ask the vet if you can crush the medication. If so, use a pill crusher crush the pill and mix it with only tuna juice. The cat will lick it clean. And you can tell after whether any is remaining. Pour a lil more if she didn’t quite get it all. Also we tried  churru but it was hit or miss with ours. 

4. Try different renal moist/canned foods. There are some non-prescription, like Weruva has variety pack of low phos food. Ours ended up being only willing to eat royal canin e prescription. 

5. Phosphorous is the enemy. A phosbinder will help phosphorous pass thru kidneys. You can find them on Amazon, we used Rxbinder or something like that, a scoop with each meal (even if low phos diet esp if you have to use tuna juice to prompt eating like we did).

6. Since cats need to drink a lot of water, night time is usually the most risk for binge drinking and vomiting water bc they lose their appetite and need encouragement to eat. Right before you go to sleep, feed them the above meal of ingredients. This helped them stay hydrated while we slept.

6a. Keep treats out of reach but right next to your bed nightstand, esp if she’s smart and motivated to rip into those. If you feel like they were light on food for the day, give them treats right before bed. Ours went nuts for greenies - dental and smarties greenies. 

6b. Feed them a few treats right when you wake up wake up. That way you don’t have to rush to get her the meal because it’ll get sustenance in her tummy before they inevitably inhale water as you try to get ready for the day. The goal is a steady streak of moist nutrients throughout the day- 4x/day if possible.

6c. She may also eat only a little at first and then walk away. Just follow her to the next spot she sits and place it in front of her again. And one more time. She just needs encouragement and they get fatigued eating, so promoting like this helps. Pour a lil of that tuna juice if she’s still not eating.
6d. If you can catch her while she is napping, hold the bowl under her nose to sniff - cats natural instinct is to start eating as they wake. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t.

7. Get a water fountain. The sound of the water encourages them to drink. 

7a. Weird as this sounds, our kitties were drawn to the water more when we placed an avocado seed (rinsed of all soft green) in them. If you have dogs, they are not safe for dogs to eat. 

8. We found all prescriptions cheapest and quickest from chewy. Several vets wanted it to go through one in NJ, but they were 3x more expensive than chewy and took longer.

9. The urine will smell. We found our cats preferred crystal litter. We found this litter absorbed the smell the most, and our kitties would continue to use it. Scoop it everyday, and use a hypoallergenic cleaner to wipe down the sides esp if yours is a sprayer. Be careful of the litters with a lot of dust.

10. Also, our cats were more likely to eat with the ergonomic bowls, where the bowls sit up higher, not on the ground. 

11. The vet showed us one way to tell how hydrated or dehydrated our cats were. Grab/pull the excess skin on their back up a little and see if the fur stays up or reshapes quickly. If the fur takes its time to fall, it’s an informal clue your cats hydration might be low.  

12. Get copies of your cats vet records and place a copy in an outside pocket on the pet carrier, get the kidney values(not just the stage) and history. That way if for any reason you need to take her to the emergency room, you can hand it right over.

That’s all I can remember right now, but I’ll edit if we think of anything else. Hope this helps. The hardest part is breaking the cycle of vomiting water and not eating. The above was all through trial and error over the course of years, I can’t promise you it will work for your fur baby but it did for ours. If she doesn’t have complications and you’re able to get it under control, she can live for quite a few years with this condition. It is a lot of maintenance. Yes, I’m aware I spoiled the sh** out of our cats, oy it hit the budget hard with the amount of $$ we spent, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

418,Chewy,chewy pharmacy,l6ens9r,1d4hnfv,2024-05-30,Chewy can be extremely time consuming and difficult for vets to deal with. That has been a longstanding problem with the way Chewy operates where it is cheap and customer friendly but clinic unfriendly. So a lot of clinics charge fees to cover the staff time needed to deal with them and the frequently “lost” faxed in prescriptions or don’t work with them.,comment,19,,,https://reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/1d4hnfv/veterinarian_gatekeepers/l6ens9r/,Chewy
419,Chewy,chewy pharmacy,mcw6yjx,1ipzvle,2025-02-15,"DVM: YES! You are absolutely putting your dog at risk! 
Any entity that doesn’t require a prescription for something that typically requires a prescription should be a HUGE red flag. 
And even Chewy ended up selling a batch of counterfeit Bravecto a couple of years ago and it wasn’t discovered until some dogs got sick. 
The issue with any of these online (and this includes places like Chewy) entities is they are what is called in the industry as “third party sellers”. 
This means that if your dog gets sick or the product doesn’t work correctly, you are shit out of luck. The manufacturer does not guarantee health or safety of the product or its efficacy. 
However, when you buy your product directly from your veterinarian, the product does have the full guarantee from the manufacturer. 
Take Heartgard for example, and I will try to shorten the story but can give more details if needed: we had a client (only been seen by us once when the client moved up here) come in and their dog became heartworm positive. Dog has supposedly been on Heartgard year round since a puppy (dog is close to 2yrs now). In theory, the manufacturer would have refunded the owner their entire script (previous vet had given the owners a one year script in paper form) and paid for the entire treatment for the heart worm itself. But, the owner obtained the product from an online vendor. Doing this nullified any guarantee from the manufacturer. And legally, these online vendors don’t have to disclose any manufacturer nullifications to owners. 
If you see some of the places where and how these medications are stored at the warehouses of some of these online places, you would understand. Some medications really do need to be kept within a certain temperature range. When you are storing product in a traditional non temperature controlled warehouse, up in overstock, high in the air where the temps can get to 80+ degrees and then some during the summer, these products can lose their efficacy.",comment,2,,,https://reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/1ipzvle/purchasing_flea_tick_medication_from_online/mcw6yjx/,Chewy

They were able to call in the prescription to a compounding pharmacy no problem. I had previously thought the compounding pharmacies only did the liquid version (we can’t do liquid either), but they were able to make a pill form with her dosage that will allow us to give one pill instead of three tablets and it’s cheaper!

It wasn't until my roommate; of their own volition, after I took and shared a photo of some of the leopard geckos we had because i thought they were cute and i was talking about purchasing one; made a Google review and posted anonymously in the same Facebook group that anything was taken care of. My general manager decided to join the Facebook group and very rudely asked why a worker opened the leo enclosure for my roommate (on the post my roommate made) and my roommate messaged her to show her proof that I was not the one to make the posts. Immediately after that, my general manager messaged the work group chat to talk about the post and my name was IMMEDIATELY thrown out by another coworker and blamed me FULLY for the post and Google review.

427,Petco,Petco,1jtsqn4,N/A,2025-04-07,"Seriously PetCo?!?! I'm getting increasingly more irritated with the crap they're trying to pull. 

I am a highly experienced dog trainer. 25+ years comprehensive experience, ran my own highly successful dog training business for 14+ years, was making $85 - $100 per hour before I came to PetCo. I made the switch due to a number of factors, mostly stability and benefits. Someone of my caliber and experience level does NOT typically work for a pet store chain and they were shocked when I applied.

 Anyway, I was promised full time (32 hours in Cali) and 4 days/32 hours is what I wanted. Not only have they dropped me down to part-time and claimed I cannot be given full time, they're now trying to have me there the smallest number of hours possible while still offering a dog training program. They want to have all their cake (the benefits of offering dog training) and eat it too (give the dog trainer the bare minimum.) 

Here's the worst part - when I got hired they made me sign an NCC and shut down my dog training business outside of PetCo. I signed this with the understanding that I was getting those full time hours. This month they are drastically trying to cut hours and giving me as little time as possible, and because of the NCC I can't make up for that lost income by doing in-home training. So I'm screwed. 

The final straw is that my boss literally changed my hours and my class calendar without speaking to me about it, and she's literally got me scheduled on shifts that don't coincide with my classes. So I've got classes with students in them and the latest schedule doesn't have me there to cover it. And, she did all this and then went on PTO for 2 weeks (and she will write you up if you contact her outside of work.) So I spoke to another manager and wrote her a letter essentially saying hey, if they're not going to give me the hours I was promised, you're either going to lose your dog trainer or they need to release me from the NCC so that I can work outside of PetCo to make up that time so that I can actually survive. 

So incredibly frustrated.",post,50,0.89,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/petco/comments/1jtsqn4/seriously_petco/,Petco

I have a T Albo and wasn’t looking for another but this was weighing on me.

Last night I was driving home from dinner when I stopped at Petco to pick up an aquarium hose. I went inside and found them, but decided to buy it at a local pet store instead. On my way out I was walking past the rat section when somebody caught my eye. It was a small brown male rat, couldn't be more than a few months old. 

I bent down to check him out and he came right up to the glass. He was all alone, which made me even more upset. I knew the odds of him getting bought as a pet were low. Seeing him pressed up against the glass broke my heart. Closing time came, so I walked out and went home.

All night I thought of this little guy. He was so attentive and respondent it caught me off guard. I told myself if I was still thinking about him by the time my Saturday shift ended, I'd go back to see if he was still there. I spent the entire day googling rat cages, best bedding for rats, best rat food, etc. 

By the time I made it back to Petco, he was still there. He saw me and walked up to the glass again. I sat outside his tank, googling reasons not to pick him up.  After an hour and a half, I told myself to either crap or get off the pot. 

Now that I'm home with him, I'm feeling more guilty than ever. I've been asking myself if I made the right decision, or if this whole decision was selfish (I know it was.) He really should be introduced to another rat so he can be happy, but I dont know the first thing about how to do that/where to start. I also have two cats, and I've just read rats can transmit something called LCMV which can cause meningitis. 

I guess I'm looking for advice. Either somebody to talk me off the ledge, or if there's anyone in the Northeast region who would take him. He really is a sweet boy, and while it would break my heart I'd be willing to transport him knowing he was going to join a clan of his own. He deserves a big happy rattie family.",post,143,0.95,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/RATS/comments/1ifip3a/bought_a_rat_from_petco_really_upset/,Petco

She was very unhealthy, likely very inbred since she was from a petco, as well as i believe she was UV deficient during developmental years. I did my best with her and I managed to get her to a healthy state, but she always had issues with her digestion. I got her at the age of 2 and she just died today around 6 or 7. She’s the only reptile i’ve ever owned, and I believe I did the best I could. Regular baths, lots of healthy greens with some fruit, crickets for protein. 

She had a  visit to the vet about a year ago and they said she was perfectly healthy. The only thing I can think of is that I over fed her crickets and she became impacted. I knew about this condition, but I had always avoided it with regular massages and doing my best to balance her diet. However this last time I bought her large crickets instead of medium without thinking about it. That was my mistake. The exoskeletons were too much for her to pass and she died in the middle of the night. Was happy as a clam yesterday. Ran around the room with my girlfriend and I appearing to be healthy. I noticed she couldn’t poop yesterday, but that’s always been an issue for her so I didn’t think twice. 

I assumed she’d pass it the next day. I was wrong and had I simply massaged the bolus and broken it apart, i suspect she’d still be alive. I can make all the excuses I want like I didn’t know any better and I’ve never owned a reptile before, but I still feel like shit because she died of a preventable cause due to my lack of recognition of a serious medical emergency.

Sorry for the tangent but I suppose it’s somewhat cathartic to talk about it online. I loved her and I will always love my bearded dragon Pancake. I’d like to think she lived a better life than she was before and that she was happy, but it’s a shame she had to fall into the hands of a dumbass like me. Rest in peace my little girl.

I was expected to feed, give fresh water and clean ever single enclosure in the morning, clean wellness, opening wellness animals, pull online orders and count the registers and open up the store and do the two animal walks on top of the 25 animal CAIR sign offs… alone while one person gets to pull fish if I’m lucky then I’m written up bc it wasn’t done which mind you I didn’t know I had to do all of those things I’d never done them before and nobody reviewed the changes with me and Daniel did not tell me that’s how it was either he was to busy calling out your poor management. 

GM- you absolutely suck the stores conditions is 100% your fault. You slack, you’re lazy, you take no accountability, you’re catty, clicky and provide no guidance or training. You have told me yourself youre not going down alone over the review you worked me till I couldn’t be worked anymore. I told you I was exhausted, burnt out and you seen my work declining you seen me doing worse and worse and nobody thought mhhhh let me give her some support and see what’s going on that’s what makes a good manager is her support to her staff which you give zero you’re also sexist for the love of god stop hiring these 4’3 120 pound women to be our ops manager they can barley lift anything you dimwit! 

Assistant manager- you’re lazy plan and simple you do the least amount of work and you’re a follower and twice faced you’ll be all cool with us and not care then you flip. 

Both of you alone were watching everything I did on the cameras both of you wrote me after two days of watching me trying to find anything you didn’t offer any coaching, training or even a verbal warning. You wrote me over things nobody else was doing either. 

To the olac- you’re a fucking b!t(h you think you’re direct and upfront and you’re simply not you’re rude, unprofessional and lack manners you will have a very high turn over rate if you ever become the GM. We call you Hitler btw! You only know petco policy but your knowledge on animals is shit!!

Closing duties should be topping off water and food y’all leave dirty enclosures or how about when the olac left fish in the bags over night a new shipment and killed half of them. Or the hamster left in a cardboard box thrown in the back of wellness chewing its way out, or the dead chameleon the GM found and then left it there, or the king snake that ate the other snake bc it kept getting over you were also aware of this problem, or the hamsters being left in there enclosures dead, or the hamsters water being empty and left in there enclosures for days while it’s bedding is soaking wet, or being the night shift lod expected to work truck, do snake feedings, deep cleans and assist customers while I have one cashier or how about our OLAC telling me as long as I don’t piss her off we’re good because if I do it’ll be a fing problem, how about me working 80-90 hours then when I can’t come in early for you I’m spoken to about my attendance or all the times all of you have given everyone your manager codes or before I became lod I closed the store alone and was given the codes to every things that had one back door, front door, safe or all the animal neglect!

He was very shy but curious. His Petco name was Jovi, similar to Bon Jovi. He had lots of toys and ZuPreem pellets to eat. He even had two personal handlers to socialize with him. 

I sleep better at night knowing that my local Petco actually cares about their animals. My only nit pick would be the Betta Fish cups but that is on corporate. 

By chance last April I decided to hold this adorable little pineapple. He absolutely did NOT want to come out of the cage. With a gentle hand from the staff they got him out. 

They handed him to me….and he just accepted his fate. And he just sat in my hands like a little person. He didn’t fight, scream or bite he just sat there like a little goober. I knew in my heart that holding him was a mistake. 

Because now I knew, I couldn’t put him back into the glass tank. I knew he was going to come home with me. This little guy found his forever home. I had an empty cage set up already and food. 

Two months earlier my beloved cinnamon conure of ten years passed away. Losing May broke my heart, I bought her from the same Petco ten years earlier. This little pineapple boy was even in the same cage/tank as my first girl. 

The next day I knew I wanted to name him something tropical because he is a pineapple! I read him a few lists of tropical names and when I read Skipper. He squeaked SO LOUD! He really liked that name. The funny thing is that I didn’t like the name at first. It took me three days to adjust to the name. 

Now I can’t imagine any other name, Skipper suits him perfectly. And it is a gender neutral name. Which was great because I didn’t know his gender at the time. My mom reminded me that Barbie’s original little sister is named Skipper. My little Skipper, he is so shy but is so incredibly sweet and loving when he opens up. 

I love him so much and look forward to all adventures we will have together.

471,Petco,Petco,1k5n082,N/A,2025-04-22,"Are all salons like this, or would it be worth applying to PetsMart or Petco? My salon has dedicated bathers, so the only thing groomers do is clip and scissor dogs. We’re *supposed* to not have to wash, dry, or brush any dogs, although very very often (like every dog) the bathers just don’t brush the dogs or dry them fully so I have to do that myself. 
I work 9-5, and in those eight hours I’m scheduled with an average of 10 dogs, sometimes up to 16 dogs with most of them being full shaves, and a couple trims (such as goldens or aussies or poms) 
We’re expected to do large dogs, such as bernadoodles or standard poodles, shave downs in an hour, and small dogs, such as malteses or cavapoos, shave down in 30 minutes. 
Is this a normal expectation? I always feel rushed and i feel like my grooms turn out sloppy because of it. I ask for advice from the higher ups on how to improve my groom quality, but all I get are tips on how to be faster. 
It takes me 45 minutes to an hour on small dogs and an hour to an hour and a half for big dogs, but I recognize that I’m still starting out and dont have my speed down as much as my coworkers who have been grooming for 6 months to a couple years have. But I stay an hour and a half late almost every day to catch up, and because I’ll have to spend an extra 15 or so minutes on every dog I get brushing out any tangles or mats in their ears and tail or coat if they’re getting a guard comb since the bathers aren’t doing all that they should. 


Some background: I’ve been doing haircuts at a corporate salon for a month now. I worked here as a bather since January, and I went to grooming school back in September, but this is my first actual grooming job. I’m very much a baby groomer. 
My salon is one of those places that only does “puppy cuts”; same length all over body and a round head. Sometimes we’ll take a client wanting a standard cut, but that’s very rare and we’re not supposed to do it. I’m often the one who ends up doing the standard cuts at this point though because I’m the only groomer who still works there that knows how to do them besides the manager. 
I went with this place because not a lot of salons in the area are hiring baby groomers besides petsmart, and everyone I work with says petsmart is awful; and because I’m not very confident in my skills so I thought this would be a good place to learn more. But I don’t feel like I’m learning anything anymore. I feel like my quality has gotten worse just because everything is so rushed. 

I’m not totally miserable here, I love my coworkers so much and I love the dogs I get to work with. So if it’s a common thing I can totally suck it up and focus on my speed. 

I attached some pics of my grooms from this week and last! They’re kinda messy and I so wish I was able to clear up all the sticky outies and flyaways 😖 ",post,134,0.99,64,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5n082,Petco

Petco came back with some pretty shi++y options for their mistake on misgendering the baby guinea I brought home from them a few weeks ago. Obviously also my fault for not double checking right away, lesson majorly learned. 

As for confirmed bb boy from Petco, we had become pretty attached to him already when we found out, & I felt terrible about giving him back to Petco of all places. 
So meet Fluffles 🩵 a Peruvian who we adopted today from our local shelter who was dumped with 2 other Peruvians. He is neutered & healthy & happy as can be & very cuddly. 
I never wanted boys. I have never had boys, I only ever wanted girls. But thankfully I have enough extra grids to make another 2x6 cage, not really extra room but going to stack them. 
So here’s to our journey with the boys now. They’ve bonded together pretty well I’d say in the last 6 hours they’ve been together in the playpen I’m housing them in for the night. Tomorrow we’ll build their cage. 
Is it better for the boys to be on top or bottom? Currently my girl 2x6 is on a table & already completely set up & has been for awhile. But if we need to do a little switcheroo it’s not a problem. 
My only issue is I’ve never stacked cages, & the girls 2x6 has a loft. Has anyone ever stacked a 2x6 with a loft before? Any tips? 
Also any tips to owning boys? I’m all ears. Biscuit is obviously NOT neutered, & the estimates I got from local vets around me run $400-600 for neutering him, so that will probably not happen for awhile. 🥴🫠 but there is no plans of breeding him ever, & we want to make sure the cages are secure so no happy accidents happen. 
Pictures of the boys together at the 6 hour mark, Biscuit won’t leave his side now 🙈🥹 I heard baby boys are easier to bond to older boys?

A couple years back, I worked a shop, and we didn't have ferrets when I started. I was bummed bc rats and ferrets were my favorite animals to have on deck, but I settled with the feeder mice (so pleasant to stick your hands in an enclosure and be swarmed by tons of cuties!)

A couple months in, we got FOUR young ferrets! I was probably the MOST excited out of everyone. 

We had two dark brown babies (girl and boy), one grey (male), and a white one (male). I ended up naming all four lol the bosses literally told me I wasn't supposed to do that, but I ignored that and decided it didn't hurt anyone. 

I regularly played with them and made sure they were happy. I wasn't allowed to give them anything, which makes sense, but I wanted so badly to enrich their little enclosure. I think I ended up sneaking a couple ferret safe toys in because well, they deserve nice things lol

The brown little lady was named Flower (after Bambi), brown lil gent was Koda (brother bear!), the grey one was Finnegan (adventure time), and then the white one, last and never least, GUNTHER! (Also adventure time lol) 

My guys I loved them all so much. I know they weren't mine, and working there I'd never be able to afford one (400$ each oof), but i definitely loved these guys! Gunther was my absolute child of a ferret. He would bite me and crocodile roll lol it hurt but less than a cat. He was the sassiest most spunky little noodle<3 I let people handle everyone BUT Gunther bc I knew he was a little terror, but I would hold him and express how much I loved him while other people petted em haha them little bites dude... I miss those guys dearly.

Anyway I hope to have ferrets of my own one day!

Last time i was here there was just one of those leaf things and they was so many geckos( of different ages) all hiding under the same leaves.

Now they have a second one but I can’t stand to look at this. Nowhere for them to climb, dishes on the floor, and not enough decor to hide.

I know it’s a pet store and the set up won’t be perfect but it could be so much better, it’s so upsetting looking at these animals being cared for like this.

Why even put them in one of the bigger tanks if they can’t use the space?

Also i know they aren’t healthy as well because my mother bought my first one from here and he has MBD.

The Sterling location is on the list of stores meant to begin selling them. Rabbits are not rodents and are not fun beginner pets. Rabbits are difficult pets that can and often are a 10+ year commitment and a large amount purchased in stores on impulse are dumped outside. Keeping a rabbit in a cage is the equivalent of caging a cat, yet these stores market them as fun pets for your children that are easy to care for. They require a carefully balanced diet, large amounts of space, and large amounts of money. Just to spay a rabbit can cost upwards of $500 or more. 

Please do not purchase these animals on a whim, and do not fall for the marketing tactics of these pet stores. The products they sell for rabbits are unethical and many of the food or treat items can actually kill them.

I have talked to countless employees who share my disgust and genuinely feel stuck and powerless to their corporate bosses who care more about profit over practice. I have seen other fish stores across the globe adopt more ethical and practical ways of selling and housing these fish in store and I am working on presenting my findings with advice to the higher ups in my local branches and farther up the corporate ladder. 

I have gotten contact information from local employees as well as done some of my own research to find ways of contacting the “big wigs” at the corporate offices. I have had success contacting larger corporations (Lowe’s, Turo, DoorDash etc.) before when I have had issues in the past with their practices etc. and am hoping that something might be able to come from this with enough evidence and advice.

The fish was outside for several hours in the cold until a relative noticed the box. We brought the fish inside and I thought he was dead since he was laying on the bottom of the bag not moving. I was extremely upset due to petco not sending me any heads up regarding the fish and figured it was over for the fish. I decided to leave the box though in a warm room over night and the next day the fish was swimming around alive and fine. I was super glad (btw I’m never buying fish off of petco’s website again.) I quickly acclimated the betta fish to my 10 gallon fish tank which has been cycled for about a month now. He’s eating and doing great.

491,Petco,Petco,1dafjdh,N/A,2024-06-07,"I want to quit. I want to quit.

I want to quit.

Yesterday, I was fired and told I lied about my grooming experience. I am beyond devastated that my clips aren’t good enough. I am beyond devastated that I was made to feel like I produce nothing but trash. I really just want to quit. 

I understand the weird rivalry between show groomers and pet groomers, but I still feel pretty icky about how I was made to feel like an imbecile because I didn’t do things the same way she does. I am autistic with ADHD and I do things in a way that work best for me and my style of grooming. During the last few weeks, I was open minded and receptive to learning a different way and broadening my knowledge about dog grooming. I was excited to have a “mentor” finally after years of getting where I am today through trial and error. 

I was more than transparent about my experience. And I will be transparent here, too.

I got my start at Petco in 2018. Shortly after I was to be sent to grooming training through their in network training program. During this, my mentor was sent to another store and they appointed the aquarium lead to be lead groomer. They sent him through training first and was in charge of mentoring me. I failed my cocker technical and almost failed my schnauzer technical because of that. He didn’t know what he was doing and I had no one to help guide me.

Shortly after passing, I went to a local mobile grooming business. For 6 weeks I was kind of trained by my boss. She helped me here and there but mostly sat in the cab while I groomed and that was it. I stayed there for 5 years. Everything I learned up until this point was self taught through trial and error and a bunch of YouTube videos. 

From there, I moved to a salon and I was pretty confident in what I have achieved by that point. Although this was considered a box store, I had the most fun working for this company and loved it. My team was wonderful and we all worked very well together. While I was here, I was confident as a groomer and confident in my craft. They sent to grooming expos to learn from the greats like Olga Zabelinskaya, Sue Zecco, Rachel Colant, and Blake Hernandez to name a few. I asked questions and learned a lot more. I continued to practice what I learned. 

From there I went to another shop that was shabby and run down with broken tablet. I enjoyed it here for the time being, but it was not the place for someone like me. They were not accepting and I was let go 2 days after I let everyone know I was neurodivergent. This led to me keeping my disabilities to myself and trying to mask to appear more “normal” or whatever.

Then went to this latest salon. I was really excited after my interview with the owner because I felt like I finally found my home salon. I felt like I was finally going to work with and for someone who was empathetic, compassionate, and informative. She told me she believed that no one could possibly learn and known everything about dogs and grooming and she felt it was important to continue grooming education, which I also believe. I felt so comfortable around her at first. I never felt that level of comfort around anyone but my best friend because let’s be honest, us neurodivergents are generally uncomfortable in most settings with most people. 

Things started off pretty rocky, the salon was an hour away so that was rough for me. My first day, I showed up at 8am, the time the salon opened. I was immediately questioned on why I was late and told my first dog got there at 8am. I was not told to show up at any given time for that day, so I showed up when the salon opened. I also did not have access to the schedule yet so I didn’t know when my first dog was coming in. None of this information was relayed to me in any way. Panic set in and it threw off my whole day, but I tried very hard to push past it. 

My grooms were heavily criticized and I was told to do things differently. Much differently than what I had learned thus far on my own, in training, and even from the seminars at the grooming expos. I was open and receptive to learning a different way because grooming had become my passion. I wanted to learn. I wanted to be better. I wanted to make people and dogs happy. I thought it said something about me and my competence to have clients want to follow me, even tho it was up to two hours away for them. I had one from Portland that would drive down just for me because he trusted his dog in my hands. I guess that didn’t matter at this new salon. 

Not once during the last few weeks was I asked to explain my thought process behind the way I did certain things. Not once was I given the opportunity to show what I can do on own without constant intervention. Trust the process. Trust me. 

Even yesterday, I wasn't asked why I left my schnauzer lines the way I did. It's because I hand scissor my skirts and blend the lines seamlessly with blenders. Not clippers, tho I did get a quick visual demonstration on how that could be done, but without any real commentary.

I was told to do things one way, but when I do it that way, I am told that is wrong and I need to it the other  way instead without any explanation as to why. Back brushing for example… I was told to use a comb, so l used a comb, then the next day, I was told to use a brush because using a comb wasn't correct. Stop confusing me and explain your process so that l understand.

I was told to ask questions, when I did, I felt like I was stupid and inconvenient for asking. Especially during the weird schnauzer groom I was in the middle of when I got fired. I did my best even though the previous groom notes were confusing and inconsistent (not what I would’ve done for a breed specific groom, and vastly different from what is explained in the “grooming bible”) on top of what the owner told me they wanted and didn't want done this time.

I was terminated in the middle of the schnauzer groom. I was told to finish it and get my stuff and go. By that point, I mentally shut down, couldn't focus on what I was doing or how or where to even begin. I was completely derailed. All I could think about was getting the hell out of there as fast as I could before the autistic/ADHD glitch that already started happening got worse (if you know, you know and I’m sorry.) All of this while sick as a dog, my son got me pretty sick, but I still showed up and worked. Thank goodness for my Ativan prescription because I would've had an autistic meltdown right then and there. It allowed me to hold in all emotion and hold back tears until I got to my car and started the hour commute home. Turns out, it was very cathartic to drive on the backroads and cry silently to myself. 

Writing all of this out and getting my feelings out there has made me realize that I am never going to be good enough and I want to hang up my smock for good. I can’t help but feel like I’m being a baby and I’m so dramatic. This was my life, a hyper-focus that I never abandoned, something I was truly proud of and felt good at.

Now, I want to give up. I’m defeated. 

Please if you have anything mean to say, please move on, I just don’t know if I can take that right now. I just wanted to share my experience and how I’m feeling right now.",post,3840,0.98,662,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dafjdh,Petco

(Sorry in advanced that this is a long post!)

I'm a new cat owner - I've got a 6 month old lil void that chose me from the distribution system in August! Anyways, he has... what seems to be very stinky pee LOL. I was using a litter robot for a while and emptying the drawer was nasty - even after only a few days! The smell was SO strong, and recently, started smelling like rancid broccoli or something... even after like 2 days. 

I switched to a litter box and Ubbi pail - which holds the smell in SO much better than the robot was doing, but changing the bag in that? Omg still SO foul after 2-3 days and lingering in the room - that's even with scooping into little waste bags, tying them up, then putting them in the can! Interesting tho because when I scoop it, there doesn't seem to be a smell. So it seems to be happening after the pee/poop is sitting for a while. 

Hell, I opened it today for 5 seconds and I started gagging the smell is so bad!! It's barely been 4 days so what the heck.... stinks up half my house changing the bag too! 

Took him to the vet to make sure there was no UTI yesterday, but he is all healthy (which ofc is good), but now we're like ??? What is causing this? 

Starting to wonder if it's the litter... currently using Scoop Away from Costco since my sister loves it and the price is great there! But I have only been using it for a few weeks, so I'm thinking the rancid smell could be this litter specifically. 

Previously, I used Dr. Ensley's Ultra and SoPresh from Petco. Neither I feel helped with that drawer at the end of the day and were inconsistent in terms of dust.

502,Petco,Petco,1jge05i,N/A,2025-03-21,"Saying goodbye to my sweet girl today I just need to vent, to get this off my chest I guess. This is Josies story.

TL;DR she's been my rock for 13 years, and cancer sucks. I'm not ready to let her go but I refuse to let her suffer.

I got Josie from my sister who wasn't taking good care of her. After moving back in with our parents (and bringing Josie with her), she'd go to work for 8 hours, come home to change clothes, and go out partying for hours-- all while leaving Josie in her crate crying for attention and love. Josie was only a year old at the time and desperately needed to go outside, play, and do usual dog things. 

After a week or so of hearing her crying through the walls, I decided to start caring for her. Taking her outside to potty, giving her treats--the usual. It came to a point where my sister was being kicked out (again), and I offered to take Josie to keep her safe; I drew up a contract for my sister to sign saying that Josie would no longer belong to her, as my sister is a very ""take-backsies"" kind of person. 

At the time I'd just graduated from high school, and was sick with something my doctors couldn't figure out, so I wasn't working or going to school. It gave me the perfect opportunity to focus on Josie and train her properly. She learned not to bite and chew things that weren't hers, sit, lay down, play dead, and dance. She helped me recover from illness eventually. 

Over the years she'd accompany me in moving more than 10 times, all without any complaints, just happy to be around and loved. Unfortunately I've never been able to give her a super-stable life, but she's never gone without a meal, a warm place to sleep, and space to play. I wish I could have given her more stability. She deserves it.

She's helped me through so many terrible things-- a hostage situation, being blamed for a suicide, multiple miscarriages, surgeries, familial deaths, being fired multiple times, so many moves, almost being homeless, and chronic illness. She's been my rock through it all. She's been my reason for living for so many years. She's been the only reason to get out of bed some days, the only reason to smile, the only reason to take care of myself at all. 

She's been the love of my life for 13 years and, while I don't know what I'll do without her, I know that it is her time. She was diagnosed with cancer last year during a routine checkup, which eventually led to to the diagnosis of being terminal and untreatable-- we were told in September that she had ""*maybe* two more months"" to live and to do palliative care. And yet, it is March, and she's still here. But it is apparent that she is now beginning to suffer--up until the beginning of this week she was still acting like herself, with a few small changes (like refusing dry kibble), but now... she's beginning to go downhill, and I don't want her to fully go downhill. I don't want her to be in agony, I don't want her to be upset, or refuse food, or be unhappy for any reason...she doesn't deserve any of that.

So today's her last day. Today is the last day I'll get to cuddle her, to pet her, to feel her licks on my hand. 

We're planning to make it a great last day. Sausage gravy and biscuits for breakfast, going to her favorite store Petco (or as she knows it, ""pecco""), getting some good bread from a local bakery, going to the dog park, having chicken nuggets for lunch, and, eventually, seeing her *absolute favorite* veterinarian one last time. 

I love her. I'll miss her dearly. But I know this is the right thing to do. If you made it to the bottom of this wall of text, please love on your dogs as much as possible..",post,2818,1,179,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jge05i,Petco

506,Petco,Petco,1iqb4wo,N/A,2025-02-15,"Petco disaster So this is more of a vent of what happened yesterday at Petco while I was working. For context I am a Jr pet stylist, and with these new goals they are expecting me to hit, it’s basically been made impossible for me to go to academy. My hours have also been cut quite a bit.

So let me paint the story for you. I had a young Cane Corso book on me, she comes in and she’s SUPER cute but pretty nervous. Knowing how they can be I am aware they can be a pretty stubborn breed but I was up to the challenge. This puppy was probably just under a year old and super sweet. Anyways, I get her into the back and get her started on her bath. 

While doing her bath she does start panicking so I stop for a moment to let her take a breather, but this is where things turn south. I honestly probably should’ve sent her home because I tried to continue the bath, and she began panicking even more. Then, my fellow salon worker barges in, and essentially tells me I’m doing it wrong. My coworker COMPLETELY took over the groom, and wouldn’t let me take the dog back. She then went to my GM, and had the dog switched over to her, so basically the dog was stolen from me. 

Said coworker then decided it was her day to be an absolute jerk to me, and continue harassing me for the rest of the day. She kept telling me it do things, and she’s not even the GSL. She even interrupted a conversation I was having with a customer, that I was checking in. Took over the conversation completely and then told me to ask the customer what they wanted for their winter package soap. When I had legitimately asked the customer that not even a minute before and then gave me a bunch of instructions on what to do on the dog, like I had no idea what I was doing. 

I had, had enough at this point and I was trying to not loose my temper and it took everything in me to not just go off. I did end my shift, but I ended up walking out. I packed up my tools and left. It seriously is shit working for Petco. ",post,48,0.98,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/petco/comments/1iqb4wo/petco_disaster/,Petco

510,Petco,Petco,1irtmog,N/A,2025-02-17,"Dear Petco Dear Petco,

I'm not sure who to address this to, since I'm not sure how high up the problem goes. Nevertheless, here is a letter of resignation to end my employment at what, in the last year and a half, has gone from a smooth-running, happy store to a prison where every employee is on the brink of walking out mid-shift. I probably don't need to list the problems we face, because I expect they're shared by nearly every Petco store out there. Somehow, the latest corporate vision seems to be that fewer employees working fewer hours will be happy, energetic people who can engage customers and make sales like never before. Surely, the one to three employees in the building on any given shift can do this while unloading 20 pallets of merchandise in a day, keeping the shelves neat and full, working the registers, answering the phone, cleaning under all the shelves, and oh, right--the animals. (But god forbid any of those employees work overtime.) Keep in mind that one or more of these employees may be half-trained (or completely untrained) because no payroll hours are allowed for training them, and once on the schedule, they're consuming the hours of an unloader, or a cashier, etc. And now, thanks to new territory management, these new employees can do all of this for less than they would make flipping burgers or bagging groceries. (I'll let you imagine how much energy and enthusiasm they have left over for seeking out pet parents and pushing sales.)

Despite these sad conditions, a host of new demands are being unveiled, served up alongside a healthy dose of criticism for all the current metrics employees are not meeting. New district management, and now new territory management, seem to think the solution is *more* criticism. Rather than support or understanding, they come to the stores to distribute harsh words and a two-page list of things they don't like, somehow thinking that this will motivate us. Our store is like a donkey that has collapsed from too much weight--and the Petco solution is to whip it harder.

I started at this store happy to come to work, and eager to talk to people about the animals I love. Now, I can barely convince myself to get in the car. In short, I no longer want to work for a company that values neither its animals nor its people, and which seems hell-bent on torpedoing itself.

  
Most sincerely,

An ex-Petco employee",post,152,0.96,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/petco/comments/1irtmog/dear_petco/,Petco

240lbs of dog food...not to mention the petco employee just gave up putting them in my cart and went on her lunch break and I ended up having to load all the dog food from their cabinet into my cart and into my car, I'm kinda surprised they just abandoned their station like that and left the cabinet open for me (Or anyone really) to just go in and take the orders unsupervised.

Petco ferrets, or really any ferret in a pet store in the US comes from a company called Marshall's Farms. It's a breeding mill. They want to churn out as many ferrets as they can for a profit to pet stores and laboratories for animal testing. They do not care about the health and wellbeing of the animals and their ferrets are prone to many severe health issues, and expensive, early deaths. The food they offer is absolute shit and will only contribute to those early deaths (ignore the shitty contract they make you sign to only feed their food. It's obviously not enforceable. Sign it and feed something better like Ziwi.)

It can be difficult to source ferrets in the US. Rescues might not have them, and breeder contracts can be insane here with what they ask of you. It's a very difficult situation of most of us not wanting to support such a horrid company, but also wanting to ensure the ferrets they put out in pet stores get proper homes. If at all possible, I encourage any potential owner to try to adopt.

This is what I found on the Petco sub. After reading the comments it sounds like some employees are not ok with this.

""Possibly one of the worst decisions I’ve ever seen this company back pedal on. Not only are rabbits the #1 small animal routinely dumped at shelters but they are also one of the most neglected. It’s not like we even carry appropriately sized enclosures for these animals. Nope, just throw them in a critter trail to get the sale. (Even though they say they’re going to be rigorously training stores on “appropriate care”, yeah, we know how that goes.) These animals are the equivalent to bringing a small dog or cat into your home. They are NOT easy to care for whatsoever.

544,Petco,Petco,lt4vmw4,1g9a9ej,2024-10-22,"petco has been selling more “exotic” bettas. over the past few years they’ve been adding aliens, kings, kois, galaxies, marbles, more plakats, orchids, dragon scales, etc. heck, i saw an albino betta the other day

the downside is that you also invite health issues they might have had prior to purchase (since petco doesn’t take good care of their bettas), the most common in my experience being swim bladder issues (which are mostly easy fixes). those health issues would probably be less of an issue with breeders since they probably treat the bettas with more care",comment,78,,,https://reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/1g9a9ej/can_you_believe_i_found_this_betta_at_a_petco_for/lt4vmw4/,Petco
545,Petco,Petco,ljy1r3v,1f19d01,2024-08-25,"I also adopted my black capped from PetCo a few years ago. I've shared the story a few times but long story short he was in a cage by himself in the back corner of the store away from everything and everyone. He was missing his tail. He had a sign on his cage that said ""Cosmetically imperfect - 25% off"". I put my finger up to the cage and he started trying to play. Literally an instant bond. We went back the next day and got him.


We've had him 5 years now and he's a bit of a butthead sometimes but he's so full of personality and we love him so much. He has absolutely been thriving since day one and immediately grew his tail back too. He tries to imitate the dog barking which he can then make that same noise to trigger the dog to bark at nothing so he can hear noise 🤦‍♀️ 


I know and understand why people are very against buying their birds from places like PetCo but sometimes you have to do it. I always say I rescued our bird because honestly considering how ragged he looked when we got him it definitely feels like we did.",comment,91,,,https://reddit.com/r/Conures/comments/1f19d01/black_capped_conure_had_been_in_petco_for_a_year/ljy1r3v/,Petco

This was my third time at Petco Park, and the second time for my fiancée. We've been vacationing in San Diego most every year for a few years now. We try to catch a Padres game if we're there in the summer. Petco is such an incredible stadium. There's so much to do around the stadium, both inside and out. Great food, passionate fans, beautiful views of downtown, and being able to see the game from most areas of the stadium really make Petco Park standout to me. My first time there was in 2018 when the team was terrible. The atmosphere at the stadium nowadays compared to then is like night and day.

overall, i’m burnt out but im still enjoying my job relatively well, but i wish some systems petco has would be adjusted to be more partner focused (vcc, vcps, zebras, stocking, amount of employees). petco just has a major issue with money and never having the hours and capacity to hire new people.",comment,44,,,https://reddit.com/r/petco/comments/1j17fgb/has_anyone_actually_enjoyed_working_at_petco/mfhcjyg/,Petco

Whereas the petsmart near me has this employee who is a hobbyist and cares deeply for the animals in the store and does their best with what they're given.
